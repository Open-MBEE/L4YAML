/-! # `allowDirectives` across CONTENT dispatch (β.3)

    The companion to `ScannerAllowDirectives.lean`, which walks the
    *preprocessing* prefix.  This file walks the other half:
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` and every scanner it can call.

    **Why it is needed.**  The accumulation's flow-interior invariant carries
    `sc.allowDirectives = false` (an open flow collection is always dispatched
    after `scanNextToken` cleared the flag), and every accum step has to
    re-establish it for the post-state.  `accum_step_flow` gets that from the
    five indicator scanners; `accum_step_content` needs it from the seven
    content ones, which is what `dispatchContent_preserves_allowDirectives`
    below provides.  It is the LAST hypothesis of the flow-interior content
    step that is not about the grammar.

    **Why the proofs look copied.**  They are: these are the
    `_preserves_flowLevel` walks of `ScannerCorrectness.lean` with the field
    renamed.  Both proofs are field-agnostic — unfold, split, fuel-induct, and
    bottom out in `advance`/`emitAt`, neither of which touches any field but its
    own — so the scripts transfer verbatim.  The two places the transfer FAILS
    are the two functions whose job is this field: `scanDocumentStart` and
    `scanDocumentEnd` re-open directives at a `---`/`...`, so their
    `_preserves_flowLevel` twins have no `allowDirectives` counterpart and are
    deliberately absent here.  Neither is reachable from content dispatch.

    Only the transitive closure of `dispatchContent_preserves_allowDirectives`
    is cloned; the rest of the `flowLevel` chain has no consumer. -/
