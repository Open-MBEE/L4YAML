# The indent stack stands still inside a flow collection (DOCS item 67)

`[137] c-flow-sequence(n,c)` and `[140] c-flow-mapping(n,c)` are read at ONE
index from the open to the close — the enclosing block context's — so the
accumulation's flow stack carries that index and every interior step has to
hand it back with its floor intact.  It can, and for a structural reason that
costs no induction over the token walk: **nothing inside a flow writes
`indents` at all.**  There are exactly three writers, and all three are
guarded by `!inFlow`:

* §6.1's `unwindIndents`, inside `scanNextToken_preprocess`;
* `[183]`'s `pushSequenceIndent`, inside `scanBlockEntry` — whose dispatch arm
  also tests `!s.inFlow`, so the `-` never reaches the scan;
* `[187]`'s `pushMappingIndent`, inside `scanKey` and inside
  `scanValuePrepare` (the implicit key's).

So the whole file is the same observation made once per dispatcher, over the
scans a flow interior can reach.  Item 66's `preprocess_indents_or_underIndent`
asked the harder question — what preprocessing does when the unwind DID pop —
and is not needed here: `skipToContent` neither opens nor closes a collection,
so the guard that is false at the step's start is false where the unwind reads
it, and the whole `if` is the identity.

The other export is a column fact rather than an indent one, and the interior
needs it in its own right: `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural`'s first check
refuses a flow-interior token at or left of `currentIndent`, so a fall-through
says the column CLEARED the floor — which is what puts the plain walk's
`contentIndent` (its own start column) above the floor its continuation lines
are measured against.

/-! ## §1  The structural check, read as a column fact -/

/-- **A flow-interior token stands past the enclosing block indent.**
    `scanNextToken_dispatchStructural`'s FIRST test errors on
    `inFlow ∧ currentIndent ≥ 0 ∧ col ≤ currentIndent`, so a fall-through
    (`.ok none`) inside a flow says the column cleared the floor.  The
    `currentIndent < 0` case needs no check at all: a column is a `Nat`. -/
