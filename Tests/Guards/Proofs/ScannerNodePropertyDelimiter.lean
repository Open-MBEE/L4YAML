/-! # Node properties must be delimited (DOCS item 9f)

`[161] ns-flow-node(n,c)` reads `c-ns-properties(n,c)` followed by EITHER
`s-separate(n,c)` and `ns-flow-content(n,c)` OR nothing at all (`e-scalar`), and
`[104] c-ns-alias-node` is a whole node.  There is no third arm, so the character
directly after a property or alias token is separation, an entry or collection
boundary, or end of input — never the first character of content.

The scanner enforced nothing: `[&a[b]]`, `[&a{b: c}]`, `[!t"x"]`, `[!t[b]]` and
`[*x[b]]` all scanned clean in both pipelines.  §1 pins the rejections.

**What does NOT reach this test, and why the two property forms differ so much.**
`[102] ns-anchor-char` is `ns-char - c-flow-indicator`, so an anchor name absorbs
everything except `,[]{}` — `&a"x"` is ONE anchor named `a"x"`, `&a*x` one named
`a*x`, `&a&b` one named `a&b`, `&a:b` one named `a:b`, and `&a!t` one named
`a!t`.  §3 pins those as accepted, because reading them as two tokens is the
mistake this guard is one character away from making.  `[153] ns-tag-char`
additionally subtracts everything outside `ns-uri-char`, so a tag really does
stop at `"` — which is why `[!t"x"]` needed the test and `[&a"x"]` did not.

**Why this one is not gated on `s.inFlow`** (item 9e's three tests are).  It
looks only FORWARD, at the character the token's own walk stopped on, so nothing
token-less can sit between the two: the block-context counterexample that forced
9e's gate (Reflection 615) cannot arise here.  §4 pins the block-context
documents that confirms it.

The test looks only forward, so it needs no `s.inFlow` gate — but the suite
documents that forced item 9e's gate are pinned here too, because they are the
