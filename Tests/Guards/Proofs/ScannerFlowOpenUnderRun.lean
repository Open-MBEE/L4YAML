/-! # A flow open below the pending's index is refused at the gate (DOCS items 66, 172)

Item 46 left one deferral at the depth-0 flow open: the landing that under-runs
`s-indent(n)` on the OPEN itself, which no `[70] s-separate-lines(n)` derives.
Item 66 refused it at the open; item 172 moved §8.1's floor to the CLOSE
(a flow open at a level's column may be the level's next implicit KEY, so
key-vs-value is only decidable there), and the under-run family now refuses at
the break/EOF gate, by whichever of the two gate readings owns the landing:

* §1 **at a level whose slot still OFFERS a node** — the `-`'s own column, a
  props park's floor, the root value slot — the deferred floor refuses as
  `underIndentedFlowContent` at the OPEN's position: the collection stood in
  the awaited slot and no `:` resolved it (`underIndentedFlowValuePos?`,
  `[96]`-transparent through the run in front of the open).
* §1' **where the landing DEDENTS past the awaiting level**, preprocessing's
  unwind closes it (`blockEnd`), the slot holder no longer offers, and the
  same landing is §9.2's dangling node — `invalidBareDocument` at the open's
  position, the constructor the scalar twin gets.
* §2 **the landing that matches no open level never gets that far**:
  preprocessing's own trailing-content check refuses it while unwinding.  So
  the readings together cover every column below the index.
* §3 **the TAB half is §6.1's** (item 64's `LandingTabFacts`): a tab in the
  landing's indent run is `tabInIndentation`, at every column at or left of
  the floor. -/

/-! ## §4 The same family SWEPT, and the branch it prices (DOCS item 264)

The columns above are hand-typed, and a hand-typed knob chooses the answer (§9).
This section walks the landing column instead and lets the machine name the
**turnover** — the least column the scanner accepts — at every combination of
three enclosing contexts, four park kinds, both flow-open characters and four
park indents.

**Why it is worth sweeping a family already pinned.**  `accum_flow_open_depth0`
spends β.5's `dropClose` at exactly one place, `have drop_ride`, and three LIVE
arms take it — `pendingProps`, `pendingBlock` and `pendingMapValue`, one each,
all on the run-end half of this under-run:

    rcases h_ur with ⟨j, sx, hj, h_ind, _h_ws2, h_end | h_tab⟩
    · exact drop_ride                              -- §4's subject
    · exact (flowOpen_underRunTab_refuted …).elim  -- §3's half, already REFUTED

So this family is not an audit of the scanner — it is the price of the one
library proof β.5 breaks that is neither a dead branch nor the escape.  The
source says of those three rides that "no accepted scan ever consults" them; §4
is that sentence measured instead of asserted, and what it measures is that the
run-end half is refutable exactly where the tab half already is.

**The props park is why a sweep was needed and not another column.**  Its
turnover does not track its own column: an anchor at column 3 takes a flow open
at column 1.  `pendingProps.h_floor : IndentFloor sc n` carries the floor of the
context the run stands IN, not the anchor's, so the boundary sits at 1 from
indent 1 rightwards — and a grid varying only the park's own column would have
read that as an under-run being accepted. -/

/-! ## §5 Where each refusal actually happens, and what that costs (DOCS item 265)

§4 measured that no accepted scan lands the open below the park's floor.  That
is a statement about the SCANNER; the proof obligation it was measured for is
`accum_flow_open_depth0`'s, and there the question is sharper: *is the refusal
available at the step the arm is proving?*  A branch the runtime refuses five
steps downstream is still a branch the step lemma has to build.

So this section walks the same grid one reading further in.  For every landing
column strictly below the park's floor it drives `scanNextToken` itself and
records two things: whether the flow OPEN is ever dispatched, and — when it is
— how far past that dispatch the scan dies and at which gate.

What it reads splits the family in two, and only one part is the arm's to
refute:

* **54 columns never reach the lemma.**  `scanNextToken_preprocess` refuses
  them while unwinding, so `h_preprocess : … = .ok (some (s_prep, c))` is
  already a contradiction and no arm is entered.
* **144 columns dispatch the open** and die three or five steps later, at one
  of the two gates that guard a landing: §8.1's floor read on a closed
  collection (90) and §9.2's dangling run (54).  Both gates also run at the
  open's own step — on a state where the collection is not yet closed, so both
  say `.ok` there.  `h_dn` and `h_bare` are those readings AT THE OPEN, which
  is why carrying them buys nothing here: they are the right checks at the
  wrong state.

`deathShape` then reads what the gate is looking at when it fires, because that
is the fact a carrier would have to deliver from the open: at every one of the
144 the collection has closed, the last real token is its flow close, and the
open's column is still on the indent stack.  One carried fact, not two — the
two gates partition the 144 by `offersNodeSlot` alone, with no overlap and no
remainder. -/

/-! ## §6 What the carrier costs, and who pays it (DOCS item 266)

§5 showed the run-end half is FALSE and not LOCALLY false: the gates that kill
the input run three to five steps past the open, so no hypothesis of
`accum_flow_open_depth0` can refute the branch and what it costs is a CARRIER.
§10 prices a missing carrier by the PRODUCERS it touches, and this section is
the half of that price the runtime decides.  The other half —
`passenger=7 heavy=7 prop=8 consumer=1 gate=1`, pinned below — is
`scripts/carrier_price.py`.

**The transport already exists.**  `ParkAnchor sc0 s d` runs a fact from a
depth-0 flow OPEN to its CLOSE and is spent there by `ParkAnchor.dangling_eq`,
whose premises are §5's `deathShape` component for component: prefix agreement,
`s_cl.indents = s_bc.indents`, `s_cl.inFlow = false`, the last real token at the
base open's index, and that token a flow close.  So the question is not what to
build but what the existing transport refuses to carry.

Three readings answer it.

* **The park is forced.**  `carrierCore` evaluates the anchor's four transport
  fields at the death state against each candidate park.  Against
  preprocessing's state all four hold at all 144; against the state the step
  began from the hold NEVER resolves, because preprocessing's own pushes sit
  between the two arrays.  There is one park, and it is not the one the
  existing anchor uses.
* **At that park the carrier is a PASSENGER.**  `carrierPark`: preprocessing's
  cursor column IS the open's column, at all 144 — so "the open's column stands
  on the indent stack" is a fact about the park ALONE, with no reference to the
  state it is transported to, and every transport lemma carries it for free.
  At the other park the same membership holds but the column is not the park's,
  which is the difference between a passenger and a premise.
* **What blocks the existing anchor is one field.**  `anchorProp`: `parkProp`
  ("the park's last real token is a node property") holds at 18 of the 144, and
  it is a pure passenger in every transport lemma — read by the genesis and by
  the spend, by nothing in between.

And `preLaw` names the carrier's source.  Over all 198 columns, preprocessing
accepts a landing out of flow exactly when its column stands on the indent
stack: the 54 it refuses are the 54 whose column stands nowhere, and the 144 it
accepts all have it.  The datum is preprocessing's own law, one production over
from `FlowIndentStable.preprocess_indents_of_inFlow` — not a field threaded
through the pending-state invariant. -/

/-! ## §7 What the built carrier reads, at both ends (DOCS item 267)

§6 priced the carrier and named its source.  This section is the three readings
the BUILD rests on — one per design decision that could have gone the other way.

* **One carrier, two gates.**  `runStart` reads where §9.2's run begins on the
  cells that fire it.  It begins AT the open, at all 54, and no cell of the
  family puts a property in front of it — so the position §9.2 reports and the
  position §8.1 reports are the same token's, and one payload serves both
  spends.  A props-headed run would have needed a second reading.
* **What is a park fact and what is not.**  `parkFacts` reads
  `offersNodeSlot` at the death state and again at the park's own array, and
  they agree cell for cell: which gate owns a landing is fixed before the open
  is written, so the spends can take the slot as a hypothesis about the park
  rather than as a transported field.  Its last count is the genesis's own
  premise — the open token's column IS the park's cursor column.
* **Why the carrier is a payload and not a core field.**  `acceptedParks`
  walks the cells the scanner ACCEPTS.  The open's column stands on neither
  candidate park's indent stack at any of them, so a `ParkCore` that demanded
  the carrier could not be built where the `[96]` park builds one today.  The
  same walk is the membership law's control: its conclusion holds at none of
  the 378 and its hypothesis at none of them either, which is what says
  `preprocess_landing_on_stack`'s `h_below` decides the law rather than
  decorating it. -/

/-- `(rows, §9.2 fires, its run starts AT the open, the run start's column is
    the open's, that column stands on the stack, the run is props-headed)`.

    The last is the discrimination and it must be **zero**: a run headed by a
    property starts left of the bracket, and its refusal would be reported at a
    column the carrier does not name. -/

/-! ## §8 Which check kills, and whether the carrier's source can reach it
       (DOCS item 268)

§7 built the carrier and left it unconsumed: `accum_flow_open_depth0` hands
`h_kpkg none`, so the frame the under-run's open pushes is UNGATED, its node
reading is unconditional, and only `dropClose` can supply one.  What it costs to
gate that frame is the question here, and it has three parts — which check the
144 actually die at, whether anything on the proof side HOLDS that check, and
whether the carrier's source can be applied where the arm stands.

**There are four checks, not two.**  §5 read the deaths with no tail and found
them at the END-OF-INPUT gates; `tailSweep` read the same 144 dying at a
MID-STREAM gate with a sibling line after the open.  Both gates exist at both
depths, so the population splits over four checks — and §1 below reads the same
`offersNodeSlot` partition, 90 and 54, at each of them.  One carrier serves all
four; two consumers does not describe the surface.

**The two halves are not the same bill.**  Resolved in the environment rather
than grepped, §9.2's mid-stream check is held as a hypothesis by twenty-one
declarations of the accumulation and its end-of-input twin by five; §8.1's
checks are held by NONE, at either depth.  §8.1's success is derived once, at
`scanNextToken_accum_step`, and discarded on the next line while its twin
`h_dn` is threaded into twenty-one signatures.  So the 54 that die at §9.2 have
a rail that already reaches the arm, and the 90 that die at §8.1 — the majority
— have no holder to reach at all.  The census is
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/ParkBill.lean` §5.

**And the carrier's source cannot be applied at the arm.**  §2 reads the
hypotheses of `preprocess_landing_on_stack` at the state the open's step begins
with.  `needIndentCheck` is false at every one of the 144 and true at every one
after `skipToContent`: the break this family crosses is crossed INSIDE the open's
own step, so a premise stated on the incoming state names a flag the consumer
never has.  The conclusion holds at all 144 regardless, which is what says the
lemma is true and unusable rather than wrong. -/

/-- **§3 What the wiring costs, by producers** (`scripts/wire_price.py`).

    Four probes, four rings.  `gate` widens `GateOf`'s arity — who READS the
    frame's gate; `anchor` adds the carrier as a third conjunct of
    `FlowBaseAnchor` — who BUILDS a gated frame; `route` adds a hypothesis to
    `FlowBaseRoutes.value` — who supplies and who applies the node reading;
    `eof` adds one to `scanNextToken_none_stream` — who drives the end-of-input
    consumer.

    The asymmetry is the reading: putting the carrier on the anchor costs TWO
    declarations, a single transport funnel and a single producer, while
    widening the gate that reads it costs FORTY-NINE.  A carrier-aware verdict
    therefore belongs on the route, not on `GateOf`. -/
def expectedWirePrice : String := "gate=49 anchor=2 route=3 eof=1"

/-- **§10a What each `drop_ride` arm HOLDS** (`scripts/arm_price.py`).

    Twenty-four cells: eight readings against the three arms that spend the
    ride, each taken by ELABORATION at the spend site — `assumption` for the
    six that ask whether a type is inhabited in the local context, and a
    reference for the two that ask whether a NAME is bound there.  A cell is
    `P` when the arm already holds the reading and `O` when it does not; a
    derivation is a different bill from a binder, and this table is about
    binders.

    **The three arms read identically on every row but one.**  They hold
    preprocessing's equation, the sentinel base and the landing's out-of-flow
    fact, and they hold none of `preprocess_floor_eq`'s two floor premises nor
    the guard item 147's floor sits behind.  §10 reads all four of those as TRUE
    at every one of the 144 the branch admits, so the ride owes a coordinate and
    not a fact.

    The one row that discriminates is `gate_gp`, and it is the reason this table
    is taken at the arm rather than at the declaration: `propsPark_open_gate` is
    called once in the module, on the path into the FIRST arm, which obtains its
    `gp` and then discards it by handing `h_kpkg none`.  The other two never see
    it.  An environment census of that gate's callers resolves to one
    declaration and cannot say this, because all three arms live inside it. -/
def expectedArmTable : String :=
  "cells=24 paid=10 owed=14 hok=PPP base=PPP le=OOO floor=OOO \
noflow_prep=PPP park_col_ne0=OOO gate_gp=POO sibling_floor_prep=OOO"

/-- **§11 What the coordinate costs** (`scripts/coordinate_price.py`).

    Four probes, all by elaboration at the three sites that spend the ride.

    `ident` is the 3x3 matrix that fixes the arm NAMES: each of the three
    constructors declares a binder the other two do not, so a probe that merely
    REFERS to one elaborates at its own site and nowhere else.  The matrix is
    diagonal, which is how item 270's third label — `pendingContent`, an arm of
    the same `cases` that spends no ride — was caught.

    `le`, `park_col_ne0` and `floor` each ask twice: once with `assumption`,
    which is item 270's question, and once with a NAMED derivation.  `P` is what
    the arm holds, `B` what it can derive from what it holds, `O` neither.
    Reading `BBB BBB BBB`: none of the three is a fact the arm is handed and
    all three are derivations it can write.  The first two are bridges off the
    under-run's own location and off a constructor field; the third is the
    conjunct `preprocess_some_separate_at_floor` carries (item 272), spent
    against the park-column bridge above it and item 270's `noflow_prep`.

    `lib` is the arity flip on that splitter: its under-run disjunct gains a
    component that is true everywhere and is supplied in the splitter's own
    proof, so the census counts sites that must now WRITE something, not sites
    where the fact is hard.  ONE library declaration, three sites, all inside
    `accum_flow_open_depth0` — which is why item 270's table had to be taken at
    the ARM and why this census cannot read three declarations.  Compare item
    268's `gate=49`.

    The tree census is held out of this pin and out of the battery: it rebuilds
    every module that imports the patched one.  `coordinate_price.py wide`
    re-derives it. -/

/-! ## §9 The rail that is not worth building, and the source that is
    (DOCS item 269)

Item 268 measured that §8.1's check is held as a hypothesis by no declaration of
the accumulation and left one instruction: thread it from
`scanNextToken_accum_step` the way §9.2's is threaded.  §5 above already
answered that, in prose, three items earlier — *both gates also run at the
open's own step, on a state where the collection is not yet closed, so both say
`.ok` there* — and §9.1 makes the answer a number.  The rail would deliver a
reading that is true at every landing in the family for a reason that has
nothing to do with the family, so it is not built.

What IS built is the carrier's source, restated.  §9.2 reads the landing's own
floor and finds it AT the landing's column at every one of the 144, which turns
the membership into a projection of the state the arm is handed, against the
control §9.2a supplies; §9.3 reads the indent-check flag on the two states
preprocessing consults, beside a same-line control that holds the other
answer. -/

private def lastRealIsFlowClose (s : Scanner.ScannerState) : Bool :=
  match Scanner.prevRealIdx? s.tokens s.tokens.size with
  | none => false
  | some i => s.tokens[i]!.val.isFlowClose

/-- **§9.1 What a rail from the open would carry.**  `(rows, §8.1's check
    succeeds at the OPEN, its position reading is `none` there, the landing is
    ARMED there, the run's last real token is a flow close there, the position
    reading is `some` at the state the scan died at, the last real token is a
    flow close there, §9.2's position reading is `some` there)`.

    The fourth component is what stops the third from passing vacuously:
    `scanNextToken_checkFlowValueIndent` answers `.ok` outright when the landing
    is not armed, and the landing is armed at every one of the 144 — so the
    check LOOKS, and finds nothing.  The fifth says why it finds nothing, and it
    is the whole reading: `underIndentedFlowValuePos?` reports only on a run
    whose last real token is a flow CLOSE, and at the open the collection has
    not been opened.  Three to five steps later the same function answers `some`
    at exactly the ninety.

    So a rail from `scanNextToken_accum_step` to the open's arm would carry a
    true statement that discriminates nothing, and the datum the ninety die on
    is not yet a fact when the rail's head runs.  A carrier is the only
    transport that crosses those steps. -/

    complete the trichotomy and are therefore arithmetic and not evidence: with
    the second at every row they cannot read anything else, and a grid that
    never produces the other answer reports its own coverage.  `floorControl` is
    the reading that carries the evidence.  The fifth refutes the sentinel
    escape — `preprocess_landing_at_level`'s disjunct — at every row, so the
    equality is read off a stack with a real top, and it is not forced by the
    second.

    land below it and 90 land exactly at it.  One premise spans both, because it

    at every row where both hold the stale arm's conclusion is false and the

    Both refutations fire, with different reach: the line conclusion is false at

/-! ## §11 What the coordinate costs (DOCS item 271)

§10 read every premise `preprocess_floor_eq` asks for as TRUE at every one of
the 144 and none of them as nameable inside the arm, and called what the ride
owes a coordinate.  A coordinate has a price.  Item 268 measured one — `anchor=2`
against `gate=49` — but over a different datum, so the number does not transfer
without being re-read.

Re-read, two of the three premises cost **nothing**, because neither is a
carriage.  The under-run the three arms split on is LOCATED:
`WhiteRunUnderRun n sp_mid sp_prep` is `j < n` spaces off a column-0 line start,
and on the RUN-END half those spaces ARE the landing.  So the landing's column
is `j`, the index it under-ran bounds it, and each arm's own `IndentFloor`
bounds that index by the floor the step began with
(`underRunEnd_col_le_currentIndent`).  The park-column guard is one step from a
field each of the three constructors declares — `h_col0 : 0 < sp_scan.col` at
`pendingProps` and `pendingMapValue`, `h_col : sp_scan.col = n + 1` at
`pendingBlock`.

This section reads that derivation's premises and its conclusion at the runtime,
on the family and on a control the family's own boundary supplies. -/

/-- `(rows, preprocessing lands at the built column, the park's index is at most
    the incoming floor plus one, the landing is at or left of the incoming
    floor, the incoming floor is not the sentinel)`.

    The second and third are `underRunEnd_col_le_currentIndent`'s two premises
    read where the proof cannot see them — `sp_prep.col = j` after the
    column-0 line start, and `n ≤ minContentIndentOf sc` off the arm's own
    `IndentFloor` — and the fourth is its conclusion.  The fifth says the
    conclusion is not carried by the vacuous branch: a stack at its base floors
    the index at zero, where `j < n` is the under-run's own refutation, so a
    family that sat there would prove the lemma without exercising it. -/

    This is the control that says the conclusion is not an arithmetic

    ninety-six: preprocessing still lands at the built column and the park's
    index is still floored by the incoming state, because neither is a fact
    about the landing being UNDER-run.  The conclusion reads zero.  What
    separates the two families is the one premise the runtime cannot show
    directly — `j < n` — and the control is how that is established without
    asking the count to be its own evidence.

    The fifth reading is **90**, and the six cells it misses are the props park
    at indent 0 across both opens and all three outers, which build the same
    input.  Those are the grid's only sentinel floors, and they are exactly the
    cells the family above cannot reach: `floorOf "props" 0` is 0, so the

/-! ## §12 What the APPLIED source still owes (DOCS item 272)

§11 priced the coordinate and item 272 landed it:
`preprocess_some_separate_at_floor`'s under-run disjunct carries item 147's
floor, so all three premises of `preprocess_landing_on_stack` are readable at
the arm and `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack` returns its conclusion there.

What that conclusion is, exactly, is a membership on the LANDING — the column
preprocessing came to rest at, standing on the stack it came to rest with.
What `ParkSlot.ofOpen` asks for is the same membership over the OPEN TOKEN's
column, because both gates read the token's own position and not the park's
cursor (§7).  The two are the same number at every cell of this family and the
equation between them is carried by nothing: item 165's `h_optok` names the
push and the token's kind and says nothing about its position.

This section reads the two shapes, the equation between them and the gate a
frame parked at the landing would carry, at the runtime, on the family and on
the accepted boundary the family's own §4 supplies. -/

/-- `(rows, the applied source's conclusion, the genesis's premise, the two are
    the same column, §9.2's verdict at the LANDING's park, §9.2's verdict at
    the state the step began with)`.

    The second is what `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack` returns; the third is
    what `ParkSlot.ofOpen` takes; the fourth is the equation between them, and
    it is the one datum the arm cannot name.  The last two are read at the
    OPEN's own step, three to five steps before the refusal (§5's
    `distances`): a frame parked at the landing carries `GateOf (some s_prep)`
    and its producer owes the verdict at `sc`.

    The third and fourth are `carrierPark`'s own readings (§6), taken again
    here rather than cited: the point of this tuple is that the two the arm can
    derive and the one it cannot are read on ONE grid, against ONE control, so
    which of them splits is a comparison and not a cross-reference. -/

/-! ### §12a What the applied source still owes, priced

`scripts/transport_price.py`, battery stage 22c.  Six probes, read by
elaboration at the three arms that spend `drop_ride`:

* `source` — the membership `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack` returns, at the arm.
* `hcol` — the same membership in the shape `ParkSlot.ofOpen` names it, over
  the OPEN TOKEN's column, with the source offered as the derivation.  It is
  refused at all three, and the elaborator's message is a type mismatch on the
  column and nothing else.
* `genesis` — `ParkSlot s_prep s' 0` at the arm GIVEN the position equation.
  `B` says that equation is the only premise missing: the push, the token's
  kind, the indent equality and the park's flow are all bound already.
* `optok` — the ring.  Adding a conjunct to item 165's `h_optok` breaks THREE
  sites in two declarations: the two call sites in `accum_step_flow` and the
  props arm's own destructuring.  Against item 268's four rings — `gate=49
  anchor=2 route=3 eof=1` — the ring an APPLIED source needs is none of them.
* `pay` — the same ring PAID, with the two call sites supplying the column from
  the lemma they already rewrite with (`scanFlow…Start_tokens` writes the token
  at `currentPos`; the `allowDirectives` update preserves it).  `B` at all
  three says the carrier's genesis is then available with no hypothesis and no
  hole.
* `frames` / `ride` — the second ring.  The declaration builds SEVEN frames,
  and the one the under-run's open pushes is built by `drop_ride`, a single
  `have` that precedes `cases h_pending`: none of the three arms' own binders
  is in scope there, while a hypothesis of the declaration is.  A `have` has no
  arity, so no flip in this repo can see that ring. -/

/-! ## §13 What the ride can carry, and what the frame will receive
    (DOCS item 273)

§12 measured the ring an applied source needs and recorded an order for this
section: build the ride per arm, then pay `optok`.  That order was written from
what each ring BUYS.  This section reads what RECEIVES the carrier.

A ride that takes a `ParkSlot` has exactly one place to put it — the frame's
own `FlowBaseAnchor g s' 0` argument, which is what `FlowStackK` carries from
the open to the close (`FlowBaseAnchor.gate`).  That definition's `some` arm
names `ParkAnchor`: the same `ParkCore`, one field apart.  `ParkAnchor` asks
that the park's last real token be a node property; `ParkSlot` asks that the
open's column stand on the park's indent stack.

The two are not two ways of naming one fact, and the difference is not a
nameability gap of the kind §10 measured.  One of them is FALSE at most of this
family. -/

/-- `(rows, `ParkAnchor`'s own field at the landing's park, `ParkSlot`'s own
    field at the same park, cells where the slot holds and the anchor does not,
    cells where the anchor holds and the slot does not, `ParkFloor`'s own
    field)`.

    The second is what `FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm asks of this family; the
    third is what the family can supply.  §6's `anchorProp` read the second
    already and this tuple takes it again beside the other four rather than
    citing it, for §12's reason: a comparison between two censuses is not a
    comparison.

    The fourth and fifth are the two directions of that comparison and neither
    can pass vacuously — the fifth must be ZERO, or replacing the anchor with
    the slot would lose a cell the anchor holds, and a tuple that reported a
    strictly weaker ask without checking the other direction would be reporting
    an assumption.  The sixth is the frame's other half, which costs nothing at
    depth 0: the open clears the pending key and the stacked range is empty. -/

the three arms that spend `drop_ride`, on a module with item 272's ring PAID —
the payment is applied and the probes carry no hypothesis and no hole — and
four censuses taken by arity flip:

* `slot` / `floor` — `ParkSlot s_prep s' 0` and `ParkFloor s_prep s' 0`, the
  two halves a carrier-holding frame would need.  Both are `B` at all three:
  with the ring paid the genesis is available outright, and the floor costs
  nothing at depth 0.
* `prop_sc` / `prop` — `ParkAnchor`'s own remaining field, at the state the
  step began with and at the landing's park.  `BOO` against `OOO`: the props
  arm can name the property, and only at `sc`, which is the park this family
  cannot open over — preprocessing's pushes sit between the two arrays, so
  `ParkCore.ofOpen`'s push equation holds at `s_prep` and fails at `sc`.
* `gated` — `FlowBaseAnchor (some s_prep) s' 0`, the frame argument itself.
  `OOO` follows from `prop`.
* `ride` — the arity flip on `have drop_ride`: FOUR terms spend the ride, all
  inside one declaration.  Three are the live arms' run-end halves and the
  fourth is `opaque_resume`, which `pendingFlow` takes and which has no
  under-run to read a membership from.
* `add` / `swap` / `choice` — three reshapes of `FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm.
  `add` is item 268's `anchor=2` ring re-derived (the slot BESIDE the anchor);
  `swap` and `choice` put it in the anchor's place and beside it as an
  alternative, and each costs the same three declarations —
  `FlowBaseAnchor.gate`, `FlowBaseAnchor.transport`, `propsPark_open_gate`.
* `transport` — the arity flip on `FlowBaseAnchor.transport`, the funnel every
  other carrier lemma is routed through.  Nine sites in seven declarations:
  that is the second wave any of the three reshapes pays, and it is the number
  the `anchor=2` of item 268 was taken without. -/

/-! ## §14 What the CLOSE can pay for a reshaped carrier (DOCS item 274)

§13 read what receives the carrier and recorded the next step: reshape
`FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm, because the close is where the shape is decided.
The reshape's price is a count of declarations and §13 took it.  What it did
not take is the question this section is: **what the slot branch of
`FlowBaseAnchor.gate` can be closed with.**

`GateOf (some sc0)` is `danglingNodePos? sc0 = none` — a reading on the PARK's
state, which an anchor-carried frame relays from the close by an EQUATION
(`ParkAnchor.dangling_eq`).  A slot-carried frame has no equation to relay: its
two spends make a verdict FIRE, and which one fires is the `offersNodeSlot`
partition §6 measured.  Where §9.2 fires, the verdict the slot returns is the
one `GateOf` reads and it CONTRADICTS the close's own `h_closable`, so the gate
is discharged by ex falso.  Where §8.1 fires, the verdict the slot returns is
the other one, and nothing connects it to the goal.

So the reshape's real price is arithmetical, and these are the two numbers it
turns on. -/

/-- The two states of the depth-0 CLOSE — the step that takes the flow level
    from one back to zero — which are `FlowBaseAnchor.gate`'s own `s_bc` and
    `s_cl`.  Every cell of the family reaches one (§5's `deathShape`: the
    collection has closed at all 144 and dies three to five steps later). -/

/-- `(rows, §9.2 SILENT at the close, §9.2 FIRES there, §8.1 fires there, the
    gate's own verdict at the park, the slot spend's run-start premise, the
    anchor's field at the same park, the anchor's field where §8.1 fires)`.

    The second and third are the halves of the reshape.  On the third the slot
    branch closes by ex falso — `ParkSlot.dangling_fires` returns
    `danglingNodePos? s_cl = some …` against the close's `h_closable`, which
    says `none` — and on the second it does not, because the verdict that fires
    there is the fourth column's and `GateOf` does not read it.  The second and
    the fourth are the same cells counted two ways, which is what says the
    split is the `offersNodeSlot` one and not an artifact of where the walk
    stopped.

    The fifth is `GateOf (some s_prep)` itself, read at the park a gated ride
    would open over.  It is the column that decides whether gating the ride
    RETIRES the drop or merely moves it: a premise that holds at every cell of
    the family is satisfied rather than vacuous, and a route stated against it
    still has to produce the stream.

    The last two are the slot spend's own missing premise and the anchor's
    field, and they must sum to the rows: `propsRunStart` walks back exactly
    when the token in front of the open is a node property, so
    `hst : propsRunStart s_cl.tokens sc0.tokens.size = sc0.tokens.size` is the
    NEGATION of `ParkAnchor.parkProp`.  The two carriers of a `choice`
    disjunction are therefore complementary on the very premise the slot's
    spend needs.

    The eighth is the containment those two leave open: the cells the slot's
    §9.2 spend cannot reach for want of the run-start premise are exactly cells
    its §8.1 spend does reach, so ONE carrier still covers the family — but
    `propsRunStart` walks back at most two, so "props-headed implies offering"
    is a fact about this family and not a law, and the coverage is measured
    here rather than proved. -/

    Both verdicts are silent at every cell, which is what an accepted close
    looks like and what says columns two through four above report this
    family's deaths rather than the readings' defaults.  The last two split the

/-! ### §14a What the close can pay, priced

`scripts/close_price.py`, battery stage 22e.  Five rows read by elaboration —
each a standalone probe of what `FlowBaseAnchor.gate`'s slot branch could be
closed with, all five in ONE insertion and one elaboration, each carrying a
null twin that must FAIL — and five censuses taken by flip:

* `anchor` — the control: `gate`'s existing proof restated over `ParkAnchor`.
  It must read `B`, or the four rows below are measuring the scaffolding.
* `bare` — the slot branch from the premises `gate` has today: `O`.  Neither
  slot spend applies without its offer premise and neither returns an equation,
  so there is nothing to relay the close's verdict to the park's.
* `nonoffer` — with §9.2's own two premises supplied: `B`, by ex falso.
  `ParkSlot.dangling_fires` returns `danglingNodePos? s_cl = some …` and the
  close's `h_closable` says `none`.
* `offer` — with §8.1's premise instead: `O`.  The verdict that fires there is
  the one `GateOf` does not read.
* `floor` — `offer` plus the close's own §8.1 reading: `B`, again by ex falso.
  So the missing datum is ONE reading on the close's own state, and item 268
  found no declaration holding it at either depth.

* `name` — the premise the slot branch needs, written over `sc0`, on `gate`
  and on `gate_of_close`: `OO`.  Neither declaration binds the park — both
  quantify `g : Option ScannerState` — so the premise cannot be STATED where
  the spend is written, let alone where it is applied.
* `wrap` — the same premise written over `g` (`∀ sc0, g = some sc0 → …`):
  `BB`, which is the payable phrasing.
* `gate` / `close` — who must WRITE one: `1/1` and `4/1`.  The premise on
  `gate` reaches `gate_of_close` alone; on `gate_of_close` it reaches
  `accum_step_flow` at four locations.
* `apps` — the same declaration renamed rather than re-arited, which breaks
  each application exactly once: `2`.  An arity census counts error LOCATIONS,
  so the four above are the TWO base closes reported twice each — the flow
  sequence end and the flow mapping end.
* `closable` — a second verdict added where the first one lands,
  `PendingNode.pendingContent`'s `h_closable`: **20 sites in 5 declarations**
  (`content_dispatch_routed`, `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented`,
  `accum_content_pending`, `accum_step_flow`, `PendingNode.close_with_ssl`).
  That is the route's bill arriving from the consumer's side, and it is item
  268's `route=3` the way `3 + 7` was item 268's `anchor=2`. -/
