# YAML Scanner (Tokenizer) — Dispatch Umbrella

Phase 9: Character stream → Token stream.

The scanner implements the 132 lexical-layer (L) productions from YAML 1.2.2,
converting a character stream into an array of positioned `YamlToken` values.
The grammar parser (S-layer) then operates on tokens, never on raw characters.

## Architecture

```
String ──→ scan ──→ Array (Positioned YamlToken) ──→ [Grammar Parser] ──→ YamlValue
```

The scanner is a **pure function** `String → Except ScanError (Array (Positioned YamlToken))`.
Internally it uses `ScannerState` to track:
- Current position (offset, line, col)
- Indentation stack (for virtual BLOCK-START/BLOCK-END generation)
- Flow nesting level (flow vs. block context)
- Simple key tracking

## Design Decisions

1. **Batch scanning** (not lazy/on-demand like libyaml). The entire input is
   scanned to a token array before parsing begins. Pure function, easy to verify.

2. **Indentation stack** generates virtual tokens: `blockSequenceStart`,
   `blockMappingStart`, `blockEnd` — analogous to Python's INDENT/DEDENT.

3. **Scalar content is fully resolved**: escapes expanded, line folding applied,
   chomp style applied. The grammar parser receives clean strings.

4. **Context-sensitive.** The same character sequence may tokenize differently
   depending on indentation level, flow/block context, and scalar style.

## Submodule Organization (Blueprint Initiative 1 Phase 2)

The scanner was monolithic (~2761 LoC in one file).  It is now split into
role-named submodules, with this file as the dispatch umbrella:

- [`Scanner.State`](State.lean) — `ScannerState`, `WellFormed`, accessors.
- [`Scanner.Whitespace`](Whitespace.lean) — `skipWhitespace`, `skipSpaces`,
  `consumeNewline`, `skipToContent`, comments (§6.1–§6.7).
- [`Scanner.Indent`](Indent.lean) — virtual `BLOCK-*` generation via
  `unwindIndents`, `pushSequenceIndent`, `pushMappingIndent`.
- [`Scanner.Document`](Document.lean) — `---` / `...` markers, `%YAML` /
  `%TAG` directives (§6.8, §9.1.2).
- [`Scanner.NodeProperties`](NodeProperties.lean) — anchors, aliases,
  tags (§6.9).
- [`Scanner.Scalar`](Scalar.lean) — escape sequences, quoted/plain/block
  scalars, line folding (§5.7, §6.5, §7.3, §8.1).
- [`Scanner.SimpleKey`](SimpleKey.lean) — simple-key resolution,
  `scanBlockEntry` / `scanKey` / `scanValue`, candidate predicates
  (§7.4, §8.2).

This file owns the flow-collection indicator scanners (`[`, `]`, `{`,
`}`, `,`) and the `scanNextToken` dispatch / `scanLoop` / `scan` /
`scanFiltered` main loop.

## Production Rule Contracts

Each scanning function documents which YAML 1.2.2 production(s) it implements
and the contract governing its variables and state transitions.

### Variable Classification

Every numeric variable in the scanner has exactly one of these roles:

- **Position** (absolute column, 0-based): the column where something is or
  must be. Indentation levels are positions. Examples: `parentIndent`,
  `contentIndent`, `s.col`, `currentIndent`.

- **Distance** (character count): how many characters of a particular kind.
  Always non-negative. Examples: `explicitIndent` (the `m` in `s-indent(m)`),
  `spacesConsumed`.

- **Pos** (`YamlPos`): a full (offset, line, col) triple for token attribution.
  Examples: `startPos`, `simpleKey.pos`.

The fundamental relationship: `Position = Position + Distance`.
Never add two Positions or use a Distance where a Position is expected.

### Pre/Post-Condition Style

Each scanning function specifies:

- **Implements**: YAML 1.2.2 production number(s) and section.
- **Pre**: Required scanner state at entry (position, context, expectations).
- **Post**: Scanner state at exit (position advanced past matched content,
  token(s) emitted, flags set).
- **Error**: Conditions under which `Except.error` is returned.

    (trailingPropertyRunOnLine s.tokens s.line).any YamlToken.isTagProperty

/-- **Is the property run ending at the cursor already FULL?** (item 165;
    narrowed at item 170)

    `[96] c-ns-properties` is one optional `[101] c-ns-anchor-property` and one
    optional `[97] c-ns-tag-property`, so a run is at most TWO tokens long and a
    THIRD has no derivation whatever its kind.  The two guards above decide by
    KIND, and outside a flow they read the current line's run — which is exactly
    right for `&a !t &b` (refused on the line) and blind to `&a⏎!t &b`, where
    the run crosses a break and the line-filtered reading sees one token.  This
    one decides by LENGTH.

    **In block context the run's TAIL must share the cursor's line.**  A full
    run whose tail closed on an EARLIER line may belong to a PARENT node whose
    block mapping's first implicit key carries the incoming property —
    `&a4 !!map⏎&a5 !!str key5: v` (9KAX) is `[96]`-valid twice over, and the
    two runs stand adjacent in the token array because `l+block-mapping` puts
    no token between them.  A tail on the CURRENT line has no such reading:
    `[187]`'s entries each start a line, so a property following a same-line
    full run joins that run and a third has no derivation.  In a FLOW every
    node stands behind a structural token (`[`/`{`/`,`/`:`/`?`), so adjacent
    property tokens are one node's run wherever their breaks fall, and the
    length alone decides.

    What this refuses `TokenParser` also refuses one stage later; the
    cross-line block shapes it now defers (`&a !t⏎&b x`) are the parser's,
    exactly as `&a⏎!t &b x` was before item 165. -/

/-! ### §7.5 [161]: a node property is delimited (item 9f)

    `[161] ns-flow-node(n,c)` reads `c-ns-properties` followed by EITHER
    `s-separate(n,c)` and `ns-flow-content` OR nothing at all (`e-scalar`); [104]
    `c-ns-alias-node` is likewise a whole node.  There is no third arm, so the
    character directly after a property (or alias) token is separation, an entry
    or collection boundary, or end of input — never the first character of
    content.

    Unlike the three tests above this one does NOT need the `s.inFlow` gate:
    it looks only FORWARD, at the character the same token's own walk stopped on,
    so no virtual block opening can sit between the two (Reflection 615).

    The character classes differ sharply between the two property forms, which is
    why so little reaches this test on the anchor side: `[102] ns-anchor-char` is
    `ns-char - c-flow-indicator`, so `&a"x"`, `&a*x`, `&a&b` and `&a:b` are each
    ONE anchor with a funny name, and only `,[]{}` end the token.  `[153]
    ns-tag-char` also subtracts everything outside `ns-uri-char`, so a tag stops
    at `"` — which is how `[!t"x"]` scanned clean before this. -/

/-- The characters that may directly follow a node property or an alias:
    separation (§6.1 `s-white`, §5.4 `b-break`), an entry or collection boundary
    (the node ended with `e-scalar`), or end of input. -/
def propertyFollowerOk (s : ScannerState) : Bool :=
  match s.peek? with
  | none => true
  | some ch =>
    isWhiteSpaceBool ch || isLineBreakBool ch || ch == ',' || ch == ']' || ch == '}'

/-- `propertyFollowerOk` read off the state a property scan produced.  A failed
    scan reports its own error, so the test is vacuous there — which is what
    keeps item 9e's error precedence unchanged when the two guards share an
    `if`. -/
def propertyScanFollowerOk (r : Except ScanError ScannerState) : Bool :=
  match r with
  | .ok s' => propertyFollowerOk s'
  | .error _ => true

/-- Where an anchor or alias name ends, without emitting anything: the same
    `collectAnchorNameLoop` walk `scanAnchorOrAlias` runs, so the follower this
    reports is exactly the one the emitted token stops before. -/
def anchorNameEnd (s : ScannerState) : ScannerState :=
  (collectAnchorNameLoop s.advance "" (s.inputEnd - s.advance.offset)).snd

/-! ### §7.4 [150]: a flow `?` opens an entry (item 9g)

    `[150] ns-flow-pair(n,c)` is `"?" s-separate ns-flow-map-explicit-entry`, and
    a `ns-flow-pair` is an *entry* of `[138] ns-s-flow-seq-entries` /
    `[141] ns-s-flow-map-entries`.  So a `?` may only stand where the collection
    is about to read a fresh entry: directly after its own `[`/`{`, or directly
    after a `,`.

    Every other predecessor has no derivation, and the scanner used to accept
    all of them:

    | input | tokens | why there is no derivation |
    |---|---|---|
    | `[? ? a]` | `key key …` | the explicit entry's key is an `ns-flow-yaml-node`, and `? ` starts no node |
    | `[: ?]` | `key value key` | the empty-key entry's value is an `ns-flow-node`, and `? ` starts none |
    | `[&a ? b]` | `anchor key …` | `[161]`'s properties are followed by `ns-flow-content`, and `? ` is not content |

    The three predecessors that *do* complete a value (`scalar`, `alias`, `]`,
    `}`) are already rejected one dispatcher earlier by
    `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency`, so what this adds is exactly the
    `key` / `value` / property cases — the tokens that are neither an entry
    boundary nor a completed value.

    Placed as a third conjunct on the `?` arm's existing dispatch condition
    rather than as a new `if`: a `?` that fails it falls through to
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent`, where `canStartPlainScalarBool` is false
    for every character `isKeyCandidate` admits (blank, or a flow indicator —
    neither is `ns-plain-safe`), so the fall-through is always
    `.unexpectedChar`.  The dispatcher gains no `if` and no join point
    (Reflection 613). -/

/-- Inside a flow collection, is the cursor at an entry boundary, where a `?`
    may open an `[150] ns-flow-pair`?  Vacuously true in block context, where

/-! ### §7.4.1 [150]: a flow `?` is DELIMITED (item 9j)

    Item 9g pinned the `?`'s *predecessor*; this pins its *successor*, and it is
    the same production read left to right:

        [150] ns-flow-pair(n,c) ::= ( "?" s-separate(n,c)
                                       ns-flow-map-explicit-entry(n,c) )
                                  | ns-flow-pair-entry(n,c)

    The `s-separate` after the `?` is **mandatory** — inside a flow collection it
    is `s-separate-lines(n)`, whose only zero-width arm is `/* Start of line */`,
    which a `?` sitting mid-line cannot take.  So the character directly after
    the indicator is blank or a break, never a flow indicator.

    `isKeyCandidate` admits a flow indicator (`isBlankBool n || (s.inFlow &&
    isFlowIndicatorBool n)`) — that second disjunct is what let

        [?]        [?,a]       {?}       {?,a}

    scan clean in BOTH pipelines.  None of the four has a derivation: `[142]
    c-ns-flow-map-explicit-entry` can be `( e-node e-node )`, so an EMPTY explicit
    entry is legal (`[? ]`, `[? , a]` are accepted and stay accepted), but the
    `s-separate` before it is not optional.  Nor can the `?` be a plain scalar:
    `[131] ns-plain-first` admits a leading `?` only when the next character is
    `ns-plain-safe(c)`, and in flow context `ns-plain-safe-in` subtracts exactly
    `c-flow-indicator`.

    Like 9g this rides on the `?` arm's dispatch condition rather than adding an
    `if` (Reflection 613), so a `?` that fails it falls through to
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent`; and by the same argument as 9g the
    fall-through is always `.unexpectedChar`, since the follower that got it here
    is a flow indicator and so not `ns-plain-safe`. -/

/-- §7.4.1 [150] (item 9j): inside a flow collection, is the `?` followed by the
    `s-separate` its production requires?  `none` (end of input) is left to the

    **Implements** (YAML 1.2.2 §7.4):
    - `[7] c-collect-entry` = `","`

    **Pre**: Scanner at `,` inside a flow collection (`flowLevel > 0`).
    **Post**: Emits `flowEntry`, advances past `,`, sets `simpleKeyAllowed := true`
    and clears `explicitKeyLine`.
    **Error**: `invalidFlowEntry` if comma immediately follows a flow-open indicator
    (`[`, `{`) or another comma — catching leading/consecutive commas.

    **The `,` ENDS the explicit-key entry (item 9l).**  `scanKey` records
    `explicitKeyLine := some line` so that content on the `?`'s line is read as
    the explicit key's own node rather than as a fresh implicit key — the guard
    in `saveSimpleKey` and branch (1) of `scanValueClearKey`.  That scope is the
    ENTRY, not the line: `[150] ns-flow-pair`'s explicit alternative is one
    `ns-flow-seq-entry`, and `[138]`/`[141]`'s `","` starts the next one.
    Leaving the line set made every later entry on that line unable to reserve a
    simple key, so

        [? a, b: c]        [? a, : b]        [? a, : ]

    — all valid, all handled correctly by the flow-MAPPING parser — were
    REJECTED in a flow sequence (`expected ']' but reached end of tokens`): the
    retroactive `.key` token was never written, and `parseFlowSequenceLoop`
    dispatches on exactly that token.  The clear reaches exactly the entries of
    the `,`'s OWN collection (item 98): an enclosing `?`'s stamp is parked on
    `explicitKeyStack` by the flow open and restored by the matching close, so
    the block explicit key whose node contains a flow collection
    (`? [a, b]⏎: - w`) still resolves its landed `:` as `[197]`'s explicit
    value.

    token tracking clearer for formal proofs. -/

/-- §7.4 [137]/[140]: inside a flow collection every value must be
    separated from the next by `,` (entry separator) or `:` (value
    indicator).  If the previous real token completed a value
    (`YamlToken.completesFlowValue`) and the next character starts a new
    node rather than a separator or the matching close (`]`/`}`), the
    entries are adjacent with no separator — invalid YAML (`[[a][b]]`,
    `[[a]b]`, `["a""b"]`).  Fires only on spec-invalid input (the emitter
    never produces separator-less flow entries), so it does not change
    `parseYaml` behaviour on any input the parser accepts.

    Called at the entry of `scanNextToken_dispatchFlowIndicators` — the
    first per-character dispatcher, which runs for *every* character
    before falling through to block/content dispatch — so the guard
    uniformly covers flow-indicator starts (`[`, `{`) and content starts
    (scalars, quotes, `*`, `&`, `!`) alike.

    **The `:` exemption is conditional (item 9d).**  `:` is exempt only
    when it will actually be consumed as a value indicator, i.e. when
    `isValueCandidate` holds — precisely the guard on the `:` arm of
    `scanNextToken_dispatchBlockIndicators`, which runs on the same state
    immediately after this dispatcher falls through.  A `:` that fails
    that test is not a separator at all: it falls through to
    `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` and starts a *plain scalar*
    (`[126] ns-plain-first` admits `:` followed by `ns-plain-safe`), so it
    is a node start and must be treated like one.  An unconditional
    exemption admitted `[a #c⏎ :b]` and `{a #c⏎ :b}` — a comment ends the
    plain scalar `a`, and `:b` then opens a second entry with no `,`

/-! ### §7.1 [104]: an alias node ends its node (item 9h)

`[104] c-ns-alias-node ::= "*" ns-anchor-name` is a complete node — an
`ns-flow-node` [161] and, through `s-l+block-node` [196], a complete block node.
So in BLOCK context whatever follows it on the same line would have to be a
SECOND node in a slot that admits exactly one, and there is no derivation.

Every other block-context node terminator already says so, with one shared
allow-list — a line break, a `#` comment, or the `:` that makes the node an
implicit key:

* quoted scalars ([109]/[120]) — `validateTrailingContent`, called inside
  `scanDoubleQuoted` / `scanSingleQuoted`;
* a `]`/`}` that returns to block context ([137]/[140]) — `validateFlowClose`.

The alias arm had neither, and

    k: *a [b]   k: *a {b: c}   k: *a "x"   k: *a 'x'
    k: *a *a    k: *a plain    k: *a &b x  k: *a !t x   k: *a |

all scanned clean in BOTH pipelines (the parser rejects them later, with
`bareDocumentContent`, so this was never a shipped over-acceptance — but the
accumulation step could not refute them).  `validateAliasClose` closes it by
reusing the quoted-scalar sibling's own helper, so the allow-list is shared by
construction rather than restated.

**Why it is gated on `!inFlow`.**  Inside a flow collection the same job is
already done one dispatcher earlier: `.alias` is in `YamlToken.completesFlowValue`,
so `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency` (item 9b) rejects `[*a *b]` before content
dispatch is reached.

**Why the plain, block-scalar, anchor and tag arms need nothing.**  A plain
scalar in block context ABSORBS what follows (`ns-plain-safe-out` is `ns-char`,
so `k: foo [a]` is the one scalar `foo [a]`); a block scalar runs to the end of
its lines; and `&a`/`!t` are `c-ns-properties` [96], which are *supposed* to be
followed by content on the same line (`&a [b]` is one anchored node). -/

    `[196] s-l+block-node` reaches a flow node through `s-l+flow-in-block(n)`,
    whose `s-separate(n+1)` demands `s-indent(n+1)` across a break — so a flow
    collection landing AT the awaiting level's column has no derivation as the
    VALUE.  But the same open can head an implicit KEY of a sibling entry
    (`[155] c-s-implicit-json-key` is `c-flow-json-node(n/a, block-key)` — no
    indent parameter), and key-vs-value is not decidable at the open: `k:⏎[1]: b`
    is `{k: null, [1]: b}` while `k:⏎[1, 2]` derives nothing.  Item 159 measured
    the same undecidability for the dangling run (`a: 1⏎&p [b]: c` parses), and
    this reading defers the same way: the key half is resolved by the same-line
    `:` after the close (`scanValue`, through the simple key the close restores),
    and what this reports is the half no `:` resolved.

    The reading is `danglingNodePos?`'s complement on the SLOT: that check fires
    where the slot holder COMPLETES a node (the run belongs to nothing), this one
    where it OFFERS one (`YamlToken.offersNodeSlot` — the run would be the
    offered node, and stands at a column the offer cannot reach).  The two are
    mutually exclusive by that test.  The run must end in a flow CLOSE — the
    scalar at the same column is Finding A's block face, refused by
    `danglingNodePos?`'s own floor (item 177), and the two readings stay
    disjoint by the run's tail.  The column and the reported position
    are the OPEN's: a `[96]` run in front of the open belongs to the node, but
    its column is Finding A's props face (`k:⏎&p [1, 2]` completes at the
    scanner today), so the open's own landing is what this floor reads —

    `...`.  A node that is already complete, and content on a LATER line at a
    column NO OPEN LEVEL stands at, is a second bare document — `l-yaml-stream`
    offers no production for it.

    The three conjuncts are the whole reading, and each is a state field the
    scanner already maintains:

    * the landing column is not one of the open indent levels, so the content
      belongs to no collection the stream has started: it is neither the
      enclosing mapping's next key nor any indicator's content, and the
      collection it would roll in stands in a slot the completed node already
      fills.  A stack holding the sentinel alone is this condition's special
      case, since every landing column is `≥ 0` and the sentinel's is `-1`.  A
      dangling node AT an open level's own column is the complementary
      violation and belongs to its own check;
    * the last real token COMPLETES a node — `YamlToken.completesFlowValue`,
      the same set `scanNextToken_checkFlowAdjacency` reads: a scalar of any
      style, an alias, or a flow close.  Node properties and the indicators
      are excluded because they precede or separate nodes rather than
      finishing one;
    * `simpleKeyAllowed` is up, which is exactly "a line break intervened".
      Every completing scan clears the flag and only a break re-arms it, so
      the same-line readings this must not touch (`[1, 2]: v` and `"x": 1`,
      where the completed node is an implicit KEY) are excluded by the flag
      rather than by a position comparison — the completing token's `endPos`
      is not populated for scalars, so a line test on the TOKEN would read a
      multi-line scalar's start.

    Runs after the structural dispatch, so `---`, `...` and directives are
    reached first and stay legal; a plain scalar absorbs its own continuation
    lines, so the completed-node state is reachable for that style only where
    the walk stops (a comment line, `hello⏎# c⏎world`).

    The parser refuses the same inputs one layer down
    (`StreamState.validNextToken`), at the same position and with this same
    error, so the check moves the refusal without moving any output.  That holds

/-- §9.2 [211]: the DANGLING node run.  A trailing `[96]* (scalar|alias)?` whose
    start sits at an OPEN indent level's own column, and whose structural
    predecessor offers it no slot, belongs to nothing: the level it sits at is
    already occupied by the collection that opened it, and the run is neither
    that collection's next key nor any indicator's content.  §9.2 has no
    production for it, and the parser refuses it as `invalidBareDocument`.

    The three predecessors that DO offer a slot are `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`'s
    — `:`, `?` and `-` — but the slot they offer cannot reach the level's own
    column either: every alternative of `[196] s-l+block-node(n,c)` and `[185]
    s-l+block-indented(n,c)` that a scalar or alias can head spends
    `s-separate(n+1)`, whose line-crossing branch demands `s-indent(n+1)`, one
    more than the column the level itself stands at (**Finding A**, item 177 —
    the runtime half of `SBlockNode`'s `m = 0` over-approximation, item 107).
    So a props-less scalar or alias run at the column refuses whether a slot is
    offered or not — `a:⏎b`, `?⏎b⏎: v`, `-⏎b`, `k:⏎|⏎ x`.  A `[96]`-headed run
    at the column refuses for the same reason (item 178): the properties
    themselves sit inside the same alternatives, behind the same
    `s-separate(n+1)`, so `k:⏎&x a`, `-⏎&x a`, `?⏎&x a` and the props-headed
    flow tail `k:⏎&x [1]⏎: b` have no derivation either — the first held the
    parser's trailing-content refusal, the `-`/`?` faces were accepted
    outright, and all of them are refused by PyYAML's scanner.  The exemption
    keeps only the run shape another reading owns: the props-less flow-close
    tail (`k:⏎[1, 2]`, `underIndentedFlowValuePos?`'s floor, item 172, and the
    sibling flow key `k:⏎[1]: b`, which no break-ended run ever presents).  What
    stays legal is the strictly deeper landing (`a:⏎ b` is `{a: b}`) and the
    seq-spaces entries, which arrive as `-` indicators rather than as runs
    (`a:⏎- b`).  What never had a slot is a run behind a finished one
    (`a: 1⏎b`), behind a flow close (`k: [1, 2]⏎b`) or behind another dangler.

    The position reported is the RUN's start, not the cursor's, because that is
    where the offending node begins and where the parser reports.

    **The fourth reading is the crossed over-full property block** (item 180):
    a trailing run whose ADJACENT property block holds two anchors or two tags
    is not one `[96]` run, and at a line end the collection split that could
    have licensed it (`&a⏎!t &b x: 1`, the key resolved on its own line) is no
    longer available — so `&a⏎!t &b x` and its `-`-less kin have no derivation
    at ANY column, the sentinel included.  The parser refuses the same inputs
    one layer down at the EXCESS property — the first token, in token order,
    whose kind repeats in the block — and `crossedPropsExcessIdx?` reports
    exactly that index, so the refusal moves without moving its position
    (`&a⏎!t &b x` at `1,3`; the anchor-anchor pair `&p⏎&q b`, which the parser
    called `duplicateAnchor`, now reads `invalidBareDocument` at the second
    anchor — recorded, item 180).  The clause is checked AFTER the at-level
    reading, so every position this function reported before item 180 is
    unchanged.

    **The fifth reading is the run that crosses a break BELOW its start**
    (item 182).  The first three readings are taken at the run's START, and a
    run may start where no level stands and cross the break INSIDE itself: in
    `k: &x⏎a` the `&x` sits legally at column 3 and it is the CONTENT that
    lands at the mapping's own column.  `[96]`'s properties and the content
    they decorate are separated by the same `s-separate(n+1)` the first
    readings spend, so the token that starts the run's second line has no
    derivation at an open level's own column either — `k: &x⏎a`, `- &x⏎a`,
    `? &x⏎a`, `k: !t⏎a`, and the tag-headed suite case H7J7
    (`key: &x⏎!!map⏎␣␣a: b`), whose refusal moves from the parser's
    `trailingContent` to here, at the same position.  `runLineCrossPos?`
    reports that token's own position, which is where PyYAML's scanner reports
    the same inputs; the block-scalar form `k: &x⏎|⏎␣x` is refused here and
    accepted there, item 177's one named PyYAML gap read one step over.  The
    clause is checked LAST, so every position this function reported before
    item 182 is unchanged.  What keeps `k: &x⏎b: 2` is the check's own gate:
    the run has not been ended by a break while its `:` is still to come, and
    `simpleKeyAllowed` is down there — the same gate that keeps `a: 1⏎b: 2`.

    This reads the token array alone.  A property run's placeholders are never
    rewritten while the run is unresolved, so the run is visible there and no
    new state field is needed. -/

/-- §9.2 [211] mid-stream: the dangling run, once a line break has ended it.

    `simpleKeyAllowed` is that break, exactly as in
    `scanNextToken_checkBareDocument`: a run still on its own line may yet be
    resolved by a `:` (`a: 1⏎b: 2` — `b` becomes a key), and the flag is down
    there.  Runs BEFORE the structural dispatch, because a dangler dies at a
    `...`/`---` too (`a: 1⏎b⏎...`) and the marker would otherwise consume the
    step.

    **The two states are the landing's two halves, and they are not the same
    state** (item 140).  `s_land` is the landing — its flag is the break this
    check requires.  `s_run` is the state the landing ARRIVED with, and the run
    has to be read there: `scanNextToken_preprocess` unwinds the indent stack
    before it returns, and the unwind EMITS `blockEnd` and POPS the level, so a
    run whose own level the landing dedents past is no longer trailing and no
    longer sits at any open column.  Read at the landing alone, `k:⏎␣␣a: 1⏎␣␣b⏎c: 2`
    scans clean and only `TokenParser`'s `validNextToken` refuses it — at the
    same position, which is what says the two are the same refusal read at two
    depths.  `scanLoop_checkDanglingNode` below has always read the pre-unwind
    array (its own `unwindIndents s (-1)` comes after), so this makes the
    mid-stream check the end-of-input check's exact mid-stream twin.

    `skipToContent` writes neither tokens nor indents, so `s_run` may be the
    state `scanNextToken` was called with: the only writer between the two is
    the unwind, and the save's placeholders are what `prevRealIdx?` skips. -/

/-- §8.2.2 [194] / §7.5: a `:` that reaches CONTENT dispatch while a completed
    node's simple key is still recorded starts a second node in a one-node slot.

    The validators after a quoted scalar, alias, or flow close admit a `:` on
    the node's line because `[154]`/`[194]` make the node an implicit key — but
    that reading requires the `:` to BE the value indicator.  A `:` whose
    follower is not blank fails `isValueCandidate`, falls through the block
    dispatch, and would be read as a `[126]` plain-scalar head (`:b`) — a
    SECOND node after the completed one, which no production derives
    (`"a" :b`, `[1]:b`, `*x :b`).

    The recorded key separates the two `:`-as-plain families: at a genuine
    node-head position the key was saved fresh AT this character
    (`saveSimpleKey`, so `pos.offset = offset` — `k: :b`, `- :b`, `:b`), while
    after a completed node the save is the STALE one made at the node's own
    head (`pos.offset < offset`; the completed scan cleared
    `simpleKeyAllowed`, and only a line break re-arms it).  The
    `completesFlowValue` guard keeps property runs out: after `&a`/`!t` the
    stale save is the run's own head and `&x :b` is one anchored scalar.

    A flow close is refused on the TOKEN alone: `scanFlowSequenceEnd` restores
    the key saved at the matching open, and no invariant here couples that
    stack entry to the line — but after a `]`/`}` a `:` that is not the value
    indicator can never head a node (`[1]:b` glues, `[1]⏎:b` puts a bare
    document after another without `...`), so `t == .flowSequenceEnd`/`.flowMappingEnd`
    fires without consulting the key at all.

    Runs between the block-indicator and content dispatches, so a `:` that IS
    a value indicator never reaches it. -/
