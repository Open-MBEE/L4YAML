/-! # The under-indent invariant, measured (DOCS item 121)

Items 101/104/105/107 each deferred a residue to "the under-indent
invariant", and item 118's ledger carried it as ONE multi-session item.
This item measured what the name actually covers, and — like item 119's
finding one item over — it is THREE couplings, not one, each with its own
carrier, consumer, and price:

* **U1 — the `?`-line column bound (scanner-internal, KeysBehindCursor-
  shaped)**: at a boundary whose live candidate is saved on an EARLIER
  line, the CURSOR sits strictly past `currentIndent`.  [Item 122
  CORRECTED this bullet: it originally bounded the KEY's column against
  `explicitKeyCol` — a true fact that cannot refute the pair, whose
  decidable half is about the cursor; `ScalarWalkCrossLineFloor` §1 is
  the machine-checked witness.]  Serves item 104's stale-key PAIR (the
  `?`-line arm of `scanValueClearKey`), replacing the disjunction's
  deferred arm with a refutation.  Repriced by item 122 (the walks' own
  floors landed first, `ScalarWalkColFloor`) and CLOSED by item 123:
  `StaleCursorFloor.StaleKeyCursorFloor` is the invariant,
  `scanNextToken_preserves_StaleKeyCursorFloor` its clone of item 81's
  skeleton, and `colon_fires_implicit_key`'s pair punt is spent
  (`StaleCursorFloorInvariant` is the guard).
* **U2 — the park-face coupling (scanner ↔ SURFACE)**: `sc.explicitKeyLine
  = some l` at a park implies the park's `?`-frame face (`h_expl` /
  `h_vslot`) is REAL — stated as a mandatory conditional field in the
  named-family style.  This is the one item 105 measured as REQUIRED for
  `KeyPackPunt.noFrame`'s deletion: `scanValue` stamps only when
  `explicitValue` is false, `explicitValue` reads `explicitKeyLine`, and
  the two keyless `:` branches produce IDENTICAL scanner states — no
  scanner-internal fact separates them, so the discriminator must be the
  surface face the parks already hold.  The spend deletes `noFrame`
  (`by_cases` on the flag: set → the coupling's real face routes through
  the explicit opener; unset → `explicitValue` is false and the stamp is
  real).  Cost: every producer of the face-carrying parks pays or refutes
  the conditional — the "every pending" threading item 101's §measured
  note priced, a session at least.  [Item 124 landed the SCANNER half:
  `ExplicitKeyCoupling` carries both registers through every scan and
  states the five LINE-FREE `scanValue` discriminators the by_cases
  spends (guard `ExplicitKeyCouplingLadder`).  **CLOSED by item 125**,
  whose measured shape differs from the plan above in one way worth
  keeping: the coupling is NOT a park field.  `pendingMapValue.h_ivl`
  became stamp-or-FACE — the same `[185]` slot `h_vslot` carries — and
  the by_cases moved to the landed-`:` CONSUMERS, which decide their own
  dispatch state's `explicitKeyLine`/`explicitKeyCol` and spend item
  124's discriminators to make the stamp REAL.  `KeyPackPunt.noFrame` is
  gone; what is left defers at the `:` instead of parking an unstamped
  slot — a live register at the landing's own column with no pack at
  that column.  (Items 124 and 125 called that residue "the collapse
  lane"; item 126 measured the collapse UNREACHABLE and deleted it, so
  the residue is the state above and nothing else — see
  `CollapseLaneDeleted`.)]
* **U3 — the frames ↔ indent-stack coupling**: the packs' resume-twin
  lists `ks` are SURFACE data; the runtime's misindented-sibling refusal
  reads the SCANNER's indent stack (`scanNextToken_preprocess`'s unwind
  check — §2's pins).  The membership test's deferred case
  (`KeyPackPunt.dedent`'s `w ∉ ks`, items 65/99/109) becomes a refutation
  only when `ks` is coupled to the columns of `sc.indents`' open entries.
  Serves R4's landing pad narrowing; its carrier is an accumulation-
  invariant conjunct, not a park field — the widest of the three.
  [Item 127 measured the two halves and landed the SCANNER one.  Only ONE
  inclusion is needed, not an equality: the scanner's side is not a
  membership but an EQUATION — an accepted popping landing sits AT the
  top entry's column (`preprocess_landing_at_level`), on an entry the
  park already held, and §8.2.1 makes that entry a MAPPING level
  (`scanValue_top_not_sequence`).  So U3 owes only "every open mapping
  level of `sc.indents` is one of the frames".  It also found the carrier
  a reader would reach for to be empty: `BlockStack`, documented as the
  mirror of the indent stack, has no producer for either level and its
  `col` was never read — deleted, guard `UnwindLandsAtLevel`.  Item 128
  discharged that reading's one escape (a stack popped to the sentinel):
  `IndentStackBase.SentinelBase` carries `WellFormed`'s sixth conjunct
  through every scanner step, so the landing is an equation outright —
  guard `IndentBaseThreaded`.]

Order: U1 (self-contained — CLOSED by items 122+123), then U2 (unblocks
`noFrame` → shrinks the `pendingFlow` feed → 67b's deletion with
`noKeyContext`'s twin), then U3 (R4's own).  §1 pins the scanner's `explicitKeyLine` machine on the
runtime; §2 pins U3's refusal family; §3 pins the valid boundary the
couplings must not cross. -/
