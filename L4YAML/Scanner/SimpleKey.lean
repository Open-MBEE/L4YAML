# Scanner — Simple Keys, Block Entries, and Value Indicators

The machinery that YAML 1.2.2 §7.4 / §8.2 collectively calls "simple
keys": a plain scalar (or flow node) that might retroactively become
the key of a mapping once a `:` is seen on the same line.

Split from `Scanner.lean` during Blueprint Initiative 1 Phase 2.

## Scope

- Block indicator scanners: `scanBlockEntry` (`-`, §8.2.1),
  `scanKey` (`?`, §8.2.2).
- Value indicator (`:`, §8.2.2, §7.4) decomposed into five helpers
  + `scanValue`: `scanValueClearKey`, `scanValueValidate`,
  `scanValueIndentTabCheck`, `scanValuePrepare`, `scanValueTabCheck`.
- Implicit-key tracking: `saveSimpleKey`.
- Candidate-lookahead predicates: `isBlockEntryCandidate`,
  `isKeyCandidate`, `isJsonNodeToken`, `isValueCandidate`.
- Post-flow-close validation: `validateFlowClose`.

## Why one file

The simple-key resolution state machine crosses `?` (explicit key),
`:` (value indicator / implicit-key confirmation), `-` (block entry,
which clears any pending simple key), and the `saveSimpleKey` save
hook called at the start of each token dispatch.  All of these
manipulate `simpleKey` / `simpleKeyAllowed` / `simpleKeyStack` /
`explicitKeyLine` — keeping them colocated makes the state machine
inspectable in one read.

/-- **The cursor stands at a block MAPPING's own indent** (§8.2.2).

    `atSequenceIndent`'s twin, and the two are exclusive by construction: the
    stack's top is `currentIndent`, so at most one of them can hold. -/

/-- **What a `-` owes at a block mapping's own indent** (§9.2 [211]) — the third
    of the raised-flag danglers, after the completed root document and the
    dangling node run.

    A `-` at a column strictly right of the enclosing collection opens a
    sequence (`pushSequenceIndent`'s guard).  A `-` at a MAPPING's own column
    opens nothing: `[183] l+block-sequence(n)` is reached from
    `[185] s-l+block-indented(n,c)` with the auto-detected `m` allowed to be 0,
    so a zero-indented sequence is legal exactly where a NODE is expected, and
    nowhere else.  Two things expect one:

    * the slot the previous indicator opened is still empty — `:` awaiting its
      value, `?` awaiting its key, `-` awaiting its entry, with at most a
      `[96]` property run standing in between (`nodeSlotAwaited`);
    * a zero-indented sequence at this very column is already open, and this is
      its next entry (`sameIndentSequenceOpen` — a BACKWARD walk, because the
      previous entry of a zero-indented sequence is separated from this one by
      every token of the collections nested inside it).

    Otherwise the mapping entry is complete, the mapping is over, and what
    follows is a second bare document with no `---` in front of it — which is
    the reading the PARSER already takes, at this very line and column
    (`.invalidBareDocument`).  DOCS item 119 mapped the family; this is its
    third mechanism.

    Returns `Unit` on success and never modifies the state. -/

    never pushed, and a column that equals a stacked sequence level's is a
    column no mapping is open at.  An entry indicator there ends the sequence
    and has nothing to belong to.

    closes the entry; `scanKey` tests it of the cursor, at the `?` that opens

/-- **§6.1 for the `:` indicator: the run in front of the ENTRY, not in front
    of the colon.**

    A block-mapping entry is `s-indent(n) ns-l-block-map-entry(n)`
    (`[187] l+block-mapping`), and `[63] s-indent` is spaces only — so the
    whitespace run in front of the entry's first character must carry no tab.
    Where that first character is depends on the entry:

    * with an implicit key (`[192]`'s `[193] ns-s-block-map-implicit-key`), the entry
      starts at the KEY, and the run between the key and this `:` is
      `[154] ns-s-implicit-yaml-key`'s own trailing `s-separate-in-line?`,
      where `[66]`'s `s-white` admits a tab — `a\t: b` is legal, and it is the
      key's own indentation that must be clean;
    * with no key — `[192]`'s `e-node` alternative, or the explicit
      value — the entry starts AT the `:`, and its own run is the indentation.

    So the check follows the entry start, and that is what makes it exact: a
    tab-indented line whose content turns out to be a FLOW node is legal
    (`[197] s-l+flow-in-block` reaches it through `s-separate-lines`, whose
    `[69] s-flow-line-prefix` is `s-indent(n) s-separate-in-line?`), and only
    the constructs that demand a bare `s-indent` reject it.  `a:⏎␣␣→[1, 2]` and
    `a:⏎␣␣→foo` stand; `a:⏎␣␣→: b`, `a:⏎␣␣→k: v` and `a:⏎␣␣→"k": v` do not.

    The first test asks the entry-start question DIRECTLY, without consulting
    the simple-key state machine at all: if the whole of the line in front of
    this `:` is whitespace then nothing on the line can be a key, so the entry
    starts here and its run IS `[63] s-indent(n)`.  It decides exactly the
    shapes the two tests below decide — the save `scanNextToken_preprocess`
    makes at the indicator's own position sends the second test to this same
    run — but it decides them from the LINE, which is the coordinate `[187]`
    names, rather than from where a key happens to have been recorded. -/

/-- Item 333: a SIBLING entry ends the pending explicit key.  In block context a
    token that starts a line at or left of the `?`'s column and is not `:` (the
    explicit value, [197]), `-` (a compact sequence continuing the key node,
    item 320) or `?` (the next explicit key, which `scanKey` re-arms) is the next
    entry of the ENCLOSING collection — `? a⏎[1]: b` is `{a: null, [1]: b}` —
    so the register is stale: the `?` already has its empty value.  Until now
    the register survived to the entry's own `:` (where `scanValue` dropped it
    for the same reason), so a flow collection opening the sibling parked a
    live pair on `explicitKeyStack`.  On the reference inputs (items 317/320/325,
    yaml-test-suite) acceptance is unchanged — the state now says what the
    readers already decided; the one family that moves is `- ? a⏎- X⏎…` (the
    `?` inside a sequence entry), where the stale register either admitted
    `: Y` at column 0 (libyaml refuses) or refused `- : Y` (libyaml's verdict
    there is the pre-existing `- : a` divergence).  Runs after the simple-key save (whose
    register read is flow-only, so the order is immaterial to behaviour and lets
    the proofs peel it off the outside).  Pure state transformation — never
    modifies the token array. -/
