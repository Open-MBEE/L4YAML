"""PAY every optional premise whose left disjunct is itself vacuous, and let
the compiler say what the narrowing bought (DOCS item 227).

Item 226 answered "is a `_ ∨ True` premise NEEDED" by declining all of them at
once: `Or.inr trivial` everywhere, one build, zero errors.  It refused to drop
any, because the 163 are the surface a NARROWING lands on, and it closed by
asking what the narrowing is worth.

A narrowing replaces `A ∨ True` with `A`.  That is worth something only if `A`
is worth something, and for 22 of the premises it is not: their left disjunct
is `∃ ns : List Nat, ∀ nv ∈ ns, P nv`, which the EMPTY LIST proves.  So at
those sites `Or.inr trivial` and `Or.inl ⟨[], _⟩` are the same decline written
two ways, and narrowing moves the premise from one unconditional inhabitant to
another.

This script runs the other branch of item 226's experiment.  Same roster, same
insertion point, same two builds -- `decline_all_optional.shadow`'s `witness`
and `keep` seam -- but the witness is `Or.inl ⟨[], by simp⟩` and the roster is
filtered to the rows a probe has just watched the elaborator discharge that
way.  If the module builds, the PAYING branch is as free as the declining one
and the narrowing's worth at those sites is zero, by the compiler rather than
by a reading.

MEASURED (item 227), `StreamAccum`: see the item's entry in `DOCS.md`.

WHY THIS BUILDS FIRST, and again at the end: `lake env lean` does not rebuild
(item 226's own contamination).  Inherited from the module this imports.
