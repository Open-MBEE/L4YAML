# The worth census: a premise that is NARROWED is not thereby load-bearing (item 227)

Item 226 closed the question item 225 opened in both directions — nothing in
the `RELAY` lane can be dropped, and every optional premise can be and must not
be — and named what was left: **the narrowing itself**, the operation that turns
a vacuous premise into a load-bearing one and the thing items 212–218's supply
census was built to price.  Its sentence was *"the census says who would have
to pay; nothing yet says what the payment is worth"*.

This item measures the worth, and the first thing it had to measure is a
denominator nobody had: **every census of the optional population, from 212 to
226, read the `∨ True` WRAPPER and threw the left disjunct away.**  `isOptTy`
asks whether the type is an `Or` whose SECOND argument is `True`, and its
first argument was never taken, so the population's 163 rows had never been
asked what they are ABOUT.

(Items 221–224's ARM census does read a left disjunct — `armKind` selects
`ska = true ∨ R` by its LEFT, the right being deliberately unconstrained — but
that is a different family and the two are DISJOINT: no arm's right disjunct is
`True`, over all eight sites.  Selected from opposite ends, and only the arm
family was ever asked what it says.)

## What they are about

163 binders, **62 distinct faces**, 18 conclusion heads (§2).  Of those faces
**22 are themselves unconditionally inhabited** (§3): their left disjunct is
`∃ ns : List Nat, ∀ nv ∈ ns, P nv`, which the EMPTY LIST proves.  At those
sites `Or.inr trivial` and `Or.inl ⟨[], _⟩` are the same decline written two
ways, and the narrowing moves the premise from one unconditional inhabitant to
another.  §1 states that as a theorem and
`scripts/pay_chain_optional.py` runs it against the compiler: **14 of them paid
at once with `Or.inl ⟨[], by simp⟩`, one build, zero errors**, after which
Lean's linter calls 11 of the 14 unreferenced.

## The rule this item adds

**A premise that is NARROWED is not thereby load-bearing.**  Narrowing is not
one operation but a LADDER, and the plan's sentence names a rung rather than a
destination: rung 0 is `A ∨ True` (item 226 — all 163 vacuous), rung 1 is `A`
(here — 22 of them still vacuous), and only a rung that reaches a face with no
unconditional inhabitant buys anything.  Its companion, which is why the count
matters: **the sites where the narrowing is free are exactly the sites where it
is worthless**, because "free" and "worthless" are the same fact about the
face read from the producer's end and the consumer's.

## And the instrument the mandate named cannot answer

The mandate prescribed the corpus censuses (items 204, 219).  §4 measures their
reach: **138 of the 163 faces are grammar propositions over `SurfPos`**, which
no scanner-state census can spell — and of the **36** branch premises a
narrowing would actually target, **1** is in reach, covering **3** of the 99
splits.  That is the third consecutive mandate to name a corpus census and the
third time the named instrument was not the one that answered (items 217→218,
218→219).  The rule the three state together: **a plan sentence that names an
instrument is a hypothesis about the instrument, and it goes stale the same way
a number does.**

## A correction to this census's own selector, volunteered

`isOptTy` is syntactic.  §6 runs it against `whnf` and finds **one** definition
in `L4YAML` that unfolds to `_ ∨ True` — `ResumeKeyCtx` — carried by **two**
binders that fifteen items of censuses could not see.  **The optional
population is 165, not 163.**  Item 226's `expectedOptPopulation` pins what
`isOptTy` finds and still passes; what was wrong is the sentence beside it that
called 163 the population.  The 163-row measurements are unaffected — they are
measurements of the 163 — and every one of them is re-derived here unmoved.

## The worth, counted

§7 asks the other side of the same question: how many declarations PROVE
something unconditionally inhabited?  **27**, by two independent instruments
that select the same set.  Those 27 are what a narrowing is worth, as a
population: today each is a theorem `Or.inr trivial` would prove, and a
narrowing of its conclusion is what would make it an obligation.  Ten of them
are in `FlowKeyLift`, which is outside the supply census's one-module horizon —
the instrument-debt row item 218 opened and nothing had measured.

**And an axiom profile cannot see any of this.**  All 27 are `sorry`-free and
two of them are gated at `propext` alone.  CLAUDE.md §8 says to judge by the
axiom profile rather than by the absence of `sorry`; this is the next rung of
the same ladder — **a clean axiom profile does not say the STATEMENT is worth
proving.**

judgment about the face — they are what lets 163 rows be read as a shape
census instead of 163 types. -/

    enforce the expected type — it returns whatever it elaborated and leaves
    the mismatch to a later `ensureHasType` that never came, and `Meta.check`
    only asks whether that term is well typed AT ALL.  So the function
    answered `true` for any closed well-typed term, whatever the goal: at item
    228 a bare `trivial` "proved" the separation's arm, `SepCommentedArm

    against a goal that is not an `Or` leaves `?a` unassigned, so the
    metavariable test rejected it — which is to say the selection was made by
    a side effect and not by the test the docstring claims.  Both halves are

Item 217 counted, for each of the 99 optional-rooted splits, the premise its
branch is taken on; item 218 counted, for each of the 36 resulting
`(lemma, premise)` pairs, the supply edges that would have to pay.  The two
numbers have been in the same file since item 218 and have never been printed
side by side: `splits` is what a narrowing DELETES and `sup` is what it CHARGES.

This section is a derivation, not a new measurement — it reads item 218's own
`expectedBranchSupply` and §3's gated verdict.  Its control is that the parse
must recover item 217's total exactly: **99**.  A row that failed to parse
would lower it silently, which is the failure mode item 218's `accounted`
column exists to catch. -/

/-! ## §6  A correction to the selector every census since item 212 has used

`isOptTy` is `e.isAppOfArity ``Or 2 && (e.getArg! 1).isConstOf ``True` — a test
on the SYNTAX.  A `∨ True` behind a definition is invisible to it, and there is
one: `ResumeKeyCtx`.  Two binders carry it, so **the optional population is 165,
not 163**, and fifteen items of censuses have said 163.

Nothing measured on the 163 is wrong — those items measured the 163 and this
file re-derives every one of them unmoved.  What was wrong is the sentence
beside the number.  The gate below is the instrument that would have caught it
at item 212, which is why it is written as a comparison of the two selectors
rather than as a count. -/

/-! ## §7  The worth, counted: the declarations that prove nothing

A narrowing's worth is the obligation it creates.  This counts the obligations
that do not exist yet: declarations whose CONCLUSION `Or.inr trivial` proves.

Two instruments select the set — the elaborator, and `isOptTy` under `whnf` —
and the gate is that they agree EXACTLY, in both directions.  They are
independent: the first asks the compiler and the second asks the syntax after
one unfolding, and §6 is the item where those two disagreed about binders. -/
/-- `theorems` is the census POPULATION, and it moves whenever the library
    gains a theorem: 5138 at item 228, 5214 at item 229, **5238** at item 230,
    which added `SurfaceSpan` §6 and five payment lemmas to `FlowKeyLift` §4.

    The delta is NOT the count of `lemma` lines in the diff, and item 229 is
    where that was measured rather than assumed: the census walks environment
    constants, and Lean generates theorems no source line names — the equation
    lemma `SurfaceSpan.Span.eq_1` for a `def` is one of them.  A population
    that counts what the ENVIRONMENT holds cannot be reconciled against a grep
    over line starts, and this docstring no longer claims it can.

    What this pin carries is the other four numbers.  Item 230 moved one of
    them from 21 to 20, because `props_toKey` stopped concluding in `True`;
    item 231 took two more and left the population itself unmoved at 5238,
    because rebuilding eighteen motives and relocating four lemmas within a
    file adds no theorem to the environment.  **Item 232 takes the last
    `FlowKeyLift` row and is the first of the four to move the population**:
    the recursor application became a `mutual` block of eight lemmas, so the
    environment gains exactly seven theorems and reads **5245**.  The sixteen
    `.match_*` auxiliaries the block also creates are not theorems and are not
    counted here.  Item 259 adds one, `IndentStackCover.CoverStep.cons_of_top_eq`
    (a pinned top names the level a cover step opened): **5247**.  Item 267
    adds twenty-six: twenty-three authored lemmas — the transport restated on
    `ParkCore`, the carrier's own rides and two spends, the carrier's source and
    the two step facts it reads through — and the three projections the anchor's
    split nets, four inherited ones giving way to a parent projection and the
    two payloads' own: **5273**.  Item 269 restates that source as four
    declarations where item 267's form is two and retires `unwindIndents_pops`
    from `Proofs.Scanner.PreprocessIndentStable`; this denominator is the whole
    `L4YAML` namespace outside `Tests`, so it sees both sides of that and reads
    **5274**.  None of the four has an `_ ∨ True` conclusion, which is why the
    roster below does not move.  Item 271 adds the under-run's own column
    reading and item 272 the composition that spends it, one authored lemma
    each and neither with that conclusion: **5276**. -/
-- 2026-10-17: population 5294 → 5291 when the library took `module` headers --
-- three declarations the environment used to expose under a plain name are now
-- private-mangled and fall outside the `L4YAML` prefix.  The four numbers this
-- pin actually carries (byElab, byWhnf, elabOnly, whnfOnly) are unchanged, which
-- is what the docstring above says the pin is for.
--
-- Deliberately NOT canonicalized with `privateToUserName`, unlike the verdict
-- censuses: recovering the private-mangled GENERATED auxiliaries is right where
-- the instrument measures declarations and their auxiliaries, and wrong here,
-- where the population counts theorems -- it read 7676 instead of 5291, a 45%
-- inflation, because every generated matcher auxiliary joined the population.
-- 2026-10-18 (item 281): population 5344 → 5345 when `YamlToken.offersNodeSlot`
-- took its sixth arm.  ONE of the two constants the verdict censuses read, and
-- the difference is this pin's own rule: it does NOT canonicalize private names,
-- so `offersNodeSlot.eq_7` counts and the match auxiliary `match_1.eq_7`, which
-- the module system privatises, does not.  The four numbers this pin carries are
-- unchanged.  Both are named in [[HypothesisReaderCensus]].
-- 2026-10-18 (item 284): population 5345 → 5391, the 46 LEMMAS of item 284's 49
-- new declarations (the other three — `SlotFace`, `OfferPred`, `SlotGateAt` —
-- are definitions).  None concludes a no-op, so the four numbers this pin
-- carries hold; the declarations are named in [[HypothesisReaderCensus]].
-- Item 287: five more theorems — the four line-stop lemmas and
-- `sslComments_refutes_inline_residue` — none a no-op.
-- Item 293: eight more — the possibility lemmas named in
-- [[HypothesisReaderCensus]] — none a no-op.
-- Item 299: 5404 → 5459.  Gained 59, counted by this census's own filters
-- (`scratchpad/l4yaml-row12-steps/528-population-299.log`): the `docStartLine`
-- field's preservation family (54 lemmas in `ScannerCorrectness`, 4 in
-- `StreamAccum`) and `scanDocumentStart_docStartLine`; `markerOnLine`'s
-- generated equations are not in the population.  Lost 4, the remainder: the
-- three token walk lemmas and one equation Lean generated for the deleted
-- walk — `docStartOnLineLoop.eq_def`, the one the proofs named; inferred
-- from the remainder, not re-measured on the old tree.  None concludes a
-- no-op; the four numbers hold.
-- Item 300: 5459 → 5460, `flowOpen_marker` — the stamp lemma's twin, whose
-- conclusion is an `∨ True` the way `flowOpen_stamp`'s is, so `byElab` and
-- `byWhnf` read 18 and still agree.
-- 2026-10-20 (item 303): `theorems` 5460 → 5463 — `KeyFrames.close`,

-- 5302 → 5344 on 2026-10-18 (plan row 20's close, closure-log item 280): the
-- parse-side alias obligation moved to §7.1's DECLARATION set, so the carrier
-- grew and the predicate gained its tools.  What is new in kind: `AG` carries
-- three facts instead of one, which is six accessors and two closure lemmas
-- per twin plus `AG0`'s own; the properties/finalization pair that
-- `parseNode` forms needs `propsStage_ag0`,
-- `declsBound_of_props_finalization`, `applyNodeFinalization_binds`,
-- `applyNodeFinalization_decls`, `addAnchor_decls`, `anchors_of_recordPos`
-- and `tryConsume_snd_decls` per twin; the base gained the predicate's five
-- tools (`AllAliasesDeclared.mono`, `AllAliasesResolve.of_declared`,
-- `mem_of_any_beq`, `AnchorBound.mono`, `AnchorBound.push_self`); the two
-- state-preservation proofs became reader-generic, each with two corollaries;
-- and each twin gained a capstone pair plus `DeclarationsBound`'s two
-- transport lemmas.  **The clique's own 22 lemmas per twin are a RENAME and
-- move the count not at all** — `_aar` → `_aad` with a different index — and
-- four declarations LEFT: the two `findSome?` bridges the old alias leaf went
-- through, and `AllAliasesResolve.push`/`.mono`, which an index on the
-- declaration set has no use for.  The census itself is unmoved — `byElab` and
-- `byWhnf` hold at 17 and both residual lists are empty — so only the
-- denominator changed.
-- 5282 → 5292 on 2026-10-02, and the move is +11 − 1 rather than +10 of one
-- kind.  The `+11` is authored: `ParserScannableBase.lean` carries the
-- `Scannable`-valued compose chain (`stripAnchors_preserves_Scannable`,
-- `adaptForFlowContext_scannable_forall`, `wellFormedEnvS_nil`,
-- `WellFormedEnvS.cons`, the two fold helpers,
-- `compose_value_scannable_ordered`, `compose_scannable`), plus
-- `scannableValue_has_witness` and the two `*_output_scannable_composed`
-- twins.  The `−1` is auto-generated: deleting `resolveAliasesOrdered`'s
-- parse-time fallback left its alias branch with one match arm instead of two,
-- so its `eq_*` family lost a member.  Both halves were read off the
-- environment, not inferred from the diff.  The census itself is unmoved —
-- `byElab` and `byWhnf` hold at 17 and both residual lists are empty — so only
-- the denominator changed.
--
-- 5292 → 5294 the same day, and net +2 of a +3/−1: retiring
-- `compose_value_grammable_ordered` and deriving `compose_grammable` from the
-- alias-free identity instead adds `goList_fst_of_aliasFree`,
-- `goPairs_fst_of_aliasFree` and `resolveAliasesOrdered_fst_of_aliasFree`, and
-- removes the 179-line induction they replace.  §3.2.2.2 substitutes only at an
-- alias node, so on an alias-free tree the ordered walk is the identity on
-- values and no induction over the resolver is needed — the `maxHeartbeats
-- 4000000` goes with it.
-- 5278 → 5282 on 2026-10-02: `[104] c-ns-alias-node` joined `ValidNode` and
-- `NodeToValue` (plan row 5a(vii)α), and each constructor carries two
-- auto-generated theorems.  The census itself is unmoved — `byElab` and
-- `byWhnf` hold at 17 and both residual lists are empty — so only the
-- denominator changed.

/-- The 27 item 227 measured, now **18**.  Item 228 narrowed six of
    `FlowKeyLift`'s ten — `plain_toKey`, `doubleQuoted_toKey`,
    `singleQuoted_toKey`, `sep_toKey`, `sepOpt_toKey` and the `sep_toBlockKey`
    relay — from `… ∨ True` to `… ∨ <residue>`, so `Or.inr trivial` no longer
    proves them and this instrument no longer selects them.  Item 230 took the
    seventh, `props_toKey`, by giving the separation a residue that WIDENS:
    the residue arises at the interior separation's span and the conclusion is
    about the outer one, and `breakOrEnd_extend_left`/`_right` carry it there.
    **Item 231 took the recursor application and its top wrapper**,
    `flowNode_toKey` and `flowNode_toBlockKey`, by rebuilding the eight flow
    motives around `SepResidue`.  **Item 232 takes the tenth and last**,
    `flowContent_toBlockKey`, and `FlowKeyLift` is no longer represented here
    at all.

    That one was not a motive.  It recovered the CONTENT conversion by
    wrapping its input in `SFlowNode.content`, converting, and peeling the
    node back — and the peel has four arms that the conversion rules out none
    of, so its `Or.inr` had nothing to return.  What removed it was not a
    stronger proof of the same lemma but a stronger STATEMENT to read:
    `flowContent_toKey` is a lemma in its own right now, one of eight the
    `mutual` block exports
    (`Tests.Guards.SurfaceSpanCensus.expectedMotiveExport`). -/
