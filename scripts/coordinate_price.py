"""What the `drop_ride` coordinate costs, premise by premise (DOCS item 271).

Item 270 read each premise of `preprocess_landing_on_stack` with `by assumption`
at the three sites that spend `drop_ride` and scored PAID or OWED.  That
instrument asks whether a term of the type is ALREADY BOUND; it cannot tell a
premise the arm does not have from one the arm has in a different shape.  This
script asks the second question, and it asks it by elaboration too:

    bridge   null (`assumption`) against a NAMED derivation, per arm.  A row is
             PAID when the null succeeds, BRIDGE when only the named one does,
             and OWED when neither does.  The floor row's derivation is the
             conjunct `preprocess_some_separate_at_floor` carries (item 272),
             spent against the two guards it is stated behind; what it takes to
             spend the carried conjunct is what the row reads.
    ident    the 3x3 arm-identity matrix -- one binder that exists in each arm
             probed at all three sites.  The diagonal must elaborate and the
             off-diagonal must not, which is what fixes the arm NAMES.
    split    the arity flip on `preprocess_some_separate_at_floor`: its
             under-run disjunct gains a component that is true everywhere
             (`0 = 0`), supplied in the lemma's own proof, so the census is of
             sites that must now WRITE something rather than of sites where the
             fact is hard (the reading item 208 established and items 266/268
             re-used).  Errors are grouped by DECLARATION, never by line.
    wide     the same flip with the module's own three sites repaired, built
             over the tree -- otherwise the modules that consume the splitter
             are never reached, because a module that fails builds none of its
             dependents (item 269's fixpoint reading).  Held OUT of `all`, and
             out of the battery, because it rebuilds 135 modules; its number is
             quoted in DOCS rather than pinned, as `wire_price.py --wide` is.

Every probe restores the file it edited and prints the md5 either side.
