"""Price the WIRING of item 267's carrier, by producers (DOCS item 268).

Item 267 built `ParkSlot` — the transport core plus the column the depth-0 open
landed at, still standing on the park's indent stack — and two spends that fire
the gates a landing dies at.  Nothing consumes it: `accum_flow_open_depth0`
hands `h_kpkg none`, so the frame the under-run's open pushes is UNGATED, its
node route is unconditional, and only `dropClose` can supply one.

Item 268's question is what it costs to gate that frame.  Four probes, four
rings, each a different question:

    gate      `GateOf` gains an arity        -> who READS the frame's gate
    anchor    `FlowBaseAnchor` gains a third
              conjunct (`ParkSlot`)          -> who BUILDS a gated frame
    route     `FlowBaseRoutes.value` gains a
              hypothesis                     -> who supplies and who applies
                                                the node reading
    eof       `scanNextToken_none_stream`
              gains a hypothesis             -> who drives the END-OF-INPUT
                                                consumer

Each probe makes an edit that fails on ARITY, so the error list is the census of
sites that must write something rather than of sites where the fact is hard --
the reading item 208 established for `scripts/park_top_price.py` and item 266
re-used for `scripts/carrier_price.py`.

Errors are grouped by the DECLARATION that contains them, never by line number.
The script edits the file in place and always restores it.

**What this reads and what it does not.**  The probe elaborates
`StreamAccum.lean` alone (`lake env lean`), so the census is the LIBRARY's own
chain.  Guard files that mention the same names are counted separately by
`--wide`, which builds the tree instead and costs minutes rather than seconds.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/wire_price.py gate
    python3 scripts/wire_price.py all          # every probe, one line each
    python3 scripts/wire_price.py all --wide   # …over the whole tree
