"""Every dispatcher GATE named in the tree's prose resolves in the environment
(DOCS item 265).

Item 172 moved §8.1's floor for a flow open from the open's own step to the
close and the check that used to run there, `scanNextToken_checkBlockFlowIndent`,
stopped existing.  The name did not: item 265 found it in **thirty-two** places
across **fourteen** files, including the comment on the very arm that was being
priced, where it carried the claim that the arm was REFUTED — two lines above
the line that rides the escape.  Nothing checks a backticked identifier in a
docstring against the environment, so a deleted gate can keep describing the
dispatcher indefinitely, and a reader pricing that arm reads the comment first.

This is that check, over two vocabularies a comment uses to make a claim:

  * the GATES — `scanNextToken_…`, `scanLoop_…`, `scanLoopIx_…` written out in
    full, and `check<Upper>…` written short, which is how the prose usually
    names them; and
  * the REFUTATIONS — `…_refuted`, the suffix this tree gives a lemma that
    closes a branch as false.  Item 266 added them after finding a second
    phantom of exactly item 265's kind: `flowOpen_underRunEnd_refuted`, the name
    the run-end refutation WOULD take, cited in a docstring as the twin an
    existing lemma is one production in from — and resolving to no constant,
    because items 264-266 measured that it cannot be stated at that step at all.

A name resolves if it is the final component of a constant in the wide
environment, bare or under any of the three prefixes.  Family references
(`dispatchStructural_none_*`) are not constants and are counted separately;
so are names a line break splits across two lines, which this script cannot
see and says so rather than scoring them as clean.

    scripts/gate_vocab.py           # the census, compared against the pin
    scripts/gate_vocab.py --list    # …and every mention of every name

The pin lives in `Tests/Guards/Proofs/GateVocabulary.lean`, which is also the one
file the scan skips: it has to spell the deleted gate out to say what the check
is for, and that exclusion is reported as `self=` rather than left silent.  Lean
cannot read
its own comments, so the reading is Python's and the LITERAL is Lean's.
