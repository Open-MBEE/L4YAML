/-! # The PLAIN walk's blank fold line is measured against the floor (DOCS item 100)

Item 62 gated the quoted fold (`ScannerBlankFoldTabRefused`) and left the
BLOCK plain walk as "a different production, untouched".  It is not a
different production: `[135] ns-plain-multi-line(n,c)` folds through
`[134] s-ns-plain-next-line(n,c)` → `[74] s-flow-folded(n)` →
`[73] b-l-folded(n,flow-in)`, whose empty lines are `l-empty(n,flow-in)` — the
same ones.  So the same shape has no arm here either: `[63] s-indent` is
spaces (§6.1), `[69] s-flow-line-prefix(n)` admits a tab only past the `n`th
space, and `[64] s-indent-lt(n)` takes its break immediately after its short
run.

`skipBlankLinesLoop` folded such a line anyway, which is why
`skipBlankLinesLoop_prod_at` carried `∨ True` for eleven items — and that
punt was the last feeder of `indentedValue_reads_at_any_indent`'s own
catch-all, hence of three `block_dispatch_deferred` sites.  The loop now
stops AT the offending line, exactly as `foldQuotedNewlinesLoop` does; the
caller's under-indent test ends the scalar there, and the document is
refused for want of structure rather than folded into a reading no grammar
admits.

The floor is the reading index: a continuation is read at `n = currentIndent
+ 1`, so "fewer than `n` spaces" is "at or below `currentIndent`", which is
what the gate measures.  §2 and §3 are the two ways not to be that shape —
the run clears the floor, or the run is not the scalar's at all. -/

-- §1 The narrowed shape: a blank line inside a folded PLAIN scalar whose white
