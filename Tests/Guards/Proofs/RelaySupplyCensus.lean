/-! # The census over RELAYS (DOCS item 212)

Four censuses stand before this one, and all four count TERMS: over the pending
park's CONSTRUCTORS (item 198), over their APPLICATION SITES (200), over lemma
CONCLUSIONS (201), and over the conclusions' own key (202).  Items 199, 201 and
211 each recorded the same gap, in the same words:

> A conjunct **relayed** with `Or.imp`, or discharged by passing a lemma whose
> own conclusion is the `∨ True`, writes no literal `Or.inl` or `Or.inr` and
> reads `inl=0 inr=0` — neither paid nor punted.  **A relay is invisible to
> anything that counts terms**, because it writes the answer down once and the
> writing is at neither end.  What would see through it is a census that
> follows a conjunct's VALUE through the relays that carry it, and nobody has
> built one.

This is that instrument, for the SUPPLY direction: for every application in
`StreamAccum` of a constant with a `_ ∨ True` binder, resolve the argument in
that position to what actually decides it.

## What it follows, and what each answer means

* `PAY` / `DECLINE` — an `Or.inl` / `Or.inr` written at the call site, on every
  branch there is.  These are the only two a term census can see, and they are
  ~~**314 of 659**~~ **315 of 659** edges — item 216's descent found one more,
  a chain of six splitters that agree.  **Item 218: a `PAY` is an answer about
  the PROOF, and it does not promise the site survives a narrowing.**  The one
  chain of six is a `have` whose ascribed type is the wide `_ ∨ True` and whose
  proof pays it on every branch; narrowing the field it fills breaks the USE
  site while the census is right that nothing declines there.  It is named in
  `expectedCollapsedEdge` because N-218 broke at exactly it.
* `VIA g` — the argument is the result of calling `g`, so `g`'s own conclusion
  decides it.  This is the case items 199–211 called a relay and never counted.
  ~~It is the largest resolvable share after the two above, and `Or.imp` — the
  combinator item 201 named — is **39** of it.~~  **Item 213: `Or.imp` and
  `dite` are PIPES and decide nothing**, and **item 214 followed all 43 of
  them** — `resolve` now has the pipe list (`pipeArg`), so this row is **36**
  edges over 11 constants and every one of them names a lemma.  It is the
  SMALLEST of the four hidden shares, not the largest.
* `SPLIT g` — the argument is the result of a case split at the call site, so
  the site decides it on two branches rather than one.  ~~At **156** this is the
  largest hidden share~~ — **it was never a hidden share at all, and this bullet
  said so before anything measured it.**  `resolve` enters every arm now (item
  216), and of the **328** leaves under the **155** that survive, **168 are
  `DECLINE` and 160 are `PAY` and NONE is anything else**: a split is the site
  writing both answers, once per branch.  What the row hides is not a decider —
  it is the BRANCH, and `expectedSplitLanding` is where that is counted.  156
  splits, 66 distinct splitters, 151 of them two-armed and not one of them a
  single-constructor destructuring.  **Item 217 took the branch**: **145 of the
  155 branch on a value the CALLER supplied**, and **99 of those on a premise
  that is itself a `_ ∨ True`** — the site writes both answers because its own
  caller may have declined.  Only TEN branch on a fact the site derives, and
  `expectedSiteDecided` names every one of them.  **Item 218 asked whether the
  declining branch can be SELECTED** and joined this row against the supply
  rows for the first time: of the 36 `(lemma, premise)` pairs behind the 99,
  **not one has a DECLINE arm nothing can select** — `dead=0` — and only **8**
  have a caller that declines them where they are branched on.  See
  `expectedDeclineReach`.
* `RELAY` — the argument is one of the enclosing constant's OWN binders, so the
  decision belongs to ITS callers.  This is the only shape item 211 looked for.
  **68**, of which 12 arrived through a pipe — **and this row is not what a
  relay costs.**  Item 217 measured a further **99** edges that read `SPLIT`
  and branch on one of these same optional binders: the site cases on whether
  its caller declined and answers in kind, which is a relay with a case
  analysis around it.  See `expectedSplitBranch`.
* `FIELD of g#i on d` — the argument is field `i` of the constructor that split
  `d`, so items 198 and 200's census decides it and not this one.  **58**, and
  53 of them are a field of the pending park the caller was handed: the row
  reads `FIELD of PendingNode.casesOn#23 on RELAY` and `pendingProps`' own
  telescope names index 23 `h_closeFE`, which is the premise being supplied.
  Field-to-same-field, on every one of the 53.  **Item 218 followed the field
  to its CONSTRUCTOR** (`altCtorField`; all **58** resolve) and that is where
  the answer turned out to live: `expectedDeclineReach`'s **`parkHop`** counts
  the branch premises whose supply is a park field and nothing else, and it is
  the majority of them — which is why `RELAY` and `FIELD` are followed and
  everything else is a terminal.
* `LOCAL …` — a binder this census will not name.  **27**, and unlike item 212's
  82 this is not a blind spot with a sentence attached: 20 are lambdas in one
  lemma's alternative bodies and 7 sit under a SATURATED pipe, which transports
  a function nobody applies.  Both are honest locals.  The 55 that used to swell
  this row were under an OVER-APPLIED pipe — see `peelPipe`.

A `have`-bound hypothesis is followed through its beta-redex, a `let` is bound
and followed, and a case split's alternatives are entered with their constructor
fields marked and their generalized binders bound to the matcher's own trailing
arguments — so `have h := f x` reads `VIA f` and not `LOCAL h`.  That single step is the whole
difference from reading the compiler's error text, which prints the BINDER NAME
at every one of them and cannot tell a premise from a `have`.

## The reading that made this item

Item 211 falsified `content_dispatch_routed`'s optional contexts one at a time
and read, off the compiler's own error text, that of its 8 call sites **seven
relay their own `h_keyctx`** — and concluded that `KeyPackPunt.noKeyContext`
"is not missing an input, it is behind a RELAY".  All seven errors do print
`h_keyctx`.  Neither `accum_content_pending` nor `accum_content_on_noPending`
HAS an `h_keyctx` binder: both write `have h_keyctx := keyctx_of_preprocess …`,
which this census reads as `VIA`.  **Six of the seven call a producer; one
relays.**  A name is not a provenance.

Checked against the compiler, by narrowing to a fixpoint (DOCS item 212):
narrowing the premise to `∨ False` breaks 8 sites; also narrowing
`keyctx_of_preprocess`'s conclusion REPAIRS six of them — which a site that
truly relayed a premise could not be, since it would not be calling that lemma
— and the remaining supply closes at **four** decisions, three of them inside
`keyctx_of_preprocess` and one `Or.inr trivial`.

## The `∨ True` binder of `content_dispatch_routed` nobody had counted

`optTargets` below reads the optional binders off the TYPE rather than off a
hand-written list.  `content_dispatch_routed` has **six**, not the five item
211's script enumerated: `h_ref` was never in it. -/

    `dep` is what makes a multi-binder beta-redex readable.  Every argument of
    `(fun x y z => b) a₁ a₂ a₃` lives at the depth the redex was found at, but
    the binders sit at that depth, +1 and +2, so following `a₂` at `y`'s stack
    INDEX reads its de Bruijn variables one binder off.  The two agree for the

      that premise is a `PendingNode` rather than a `_ ∨ True`, so the supply

    not what decided it.  `Or.imp` alone was **39 of the 79 `VIA` edges**.

    `dite`/`ite` are deliberately NOT here.  Downward they are pipes, because a
    route census collects EVERY route and takes both arms; upward this census
    has to name ONE decider, and a two-armed decision written at the call site

    `ite` is deliberately absent.  `dite`'s arms each bind the decision's proof
    and `ite`'s bind nothing, so the two need different shapes — and `ite`
    occurs **zero** times in this module (measured, item 216: the 156 splits are
    66 distinct splitters and `ite` is not one of them).  A shape nothing

/-- What supplies an argument.  `d` is the number of binders in scope where the
    argument lives; `st` is the binder stack OUTERMOST first, so the enclosing
    constant's own `n` binders are `st[0] … st[n-1]` and `.bvar k` names
    `st[d-1-k]`.  **That indexing is only meaningful while `st.size == d`**, so
    every place this function pushes a binder truncates `st` to `d` first:
    following a value at its own `dep` leaves the stack longer than the depth,
    and item 216 measured the skew reachable (8 occurrences) and moving zero
    edges.  A bound value is followed at the depth it was bound at, which is
    what keeps the de Bruijn indices inside it meaningful.  A PIPE is followed
    into the argument that carries the decision, and a lambda is entered rather
    than reported — three `Or.imp` edges and all eight `dite` arms stop at a
    `BETA` otherwise.

    A SPLIT is entered on every arm, and the answers are joined: agreeing arms
    give one answer and the splitter joins `splits`, disagreeing arms keep the
    `SPLIT` label and their answers become `leaves`.  There is no third rule,
    because a split that answers differently on different branches HAS no single
    answer — see `expectedSplitLanding`. -/

    decided at it, 315 unconditionally and 155 per branch.  189 is the share
    items 199, 201 and 211 each described in a sentence and none could count.

    The COMPOSITION has moved three times and the walk has not gained or lost an
    edge: following the pipes (item 214) took `VIA` 79 → 36 and put the
    difference into `LOCAL` (+26), `RELAY` (+10) and `SPLIT` (+7); following the
    OVER-APPLIED ones (item 215) took `LOCAL` 82 → 27, 53 of them to `FIELD` and
    2 to `RELAY`; entering the arms (item 216) took `SPLIT` 156 → 155 and `PAY`
    43 → 44.  `edges=659` is the invariant that matters: if IT ever moves, the
    walk gained or lost an EDGE, which is a different event and a worse one.
    A row moving from hidden to visible, as one did here, is not that.
    `skipped` counts constants whose value has fewer leading lambdas than their
    type has binders — the census will not read those, and a rewrite that hides
    a proof from it has to move this number.  It moved once for a reason that is
    not a rewrite: v4.33.0 generated `FrameTail.toCtorIdx` beside `ctorIdx` for
    the derived enum — a lambda-less alias, which is why this census refused it
    — and v4.34.0 generates no such constant, so it left the module (31 → 30)
    and `edges=659` and every category held.  Isolating test:
    `scratchpad/l4yaml-434-migration/EnumAux.lean` under both toolchains.

    **Item 256 moved two DECLINEs and no edge**: the root `-`'s
    `pendingBlock.h_closeF` is a `PAY` (the seed's cover at floor 0,
    `DECLINE` 271 → 269 and `PAY` 44 → 45 with it) and the content sibling's
    is a `SPLIT` on `h_closeF_old` whose arms are a `PAY` and a `DECLINE`
    (`SPLIT` 155 → 156).  `edges=659` held, as it must.  **Item 257 moves one
    more DECLINE to a PAY**: the compact fill's `pendingBlock.h_closeF` (the
    literal from the slot's own top bound) — one edge, the fill's own
    application, `DECLINE` 269 → 268 and `PAY` 45 → 46; no split is added, so
    the split landing, the split branch and the collapsed edge stand.  **Item
    258 moves two more**: the entry park's compact and nested re-parks'
    `pendingBlock.h_closeF` (the same literal from the park's own top bound),
    one edge each, `DECLINE` 268 → 266 and `PAY` 46 → 48; no split is added.

    **Item 287 moves `edges` for the first time, and no walk lost an edge: a
    BINDER left the population.**  `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`'s `h_vslot`
    was `_ ∨ True`; its right disjunct is the caller's reading of an inline
    residue now (DOCS item 287), so it is not an optional premise and its
    eleven supply edges are not this census's: the ten callers that wrote
    `Or.inr trivial` (`DECLINE` 265 → 255) and the value park's split on
    `h_vslot51` (`SPLIT` 156 → 155).  `edges` 659 → 648.

    **Item 288 moves `edges` again, for the same reason**:
    `PendingNode.pendingMapValue.h_vslot` declines with the stamp now, so its
    six supply edges leave too — the three stamped producers' `Or.inr trivial`
    (`DECLINE` 255 → 252), the two slot openers' `Or.inl` (`PAY` 49 → 47), and
    `compact_open_map`'s split (`SPLIT` 155 → 154).  `edges` 648 → 642. -/

    six plus `content_dispatch_after_close`'s own premise, and the compiler
    agrees with both halves: narrowing its conclusion repairs exactly seven
    sites (DOCS item 212).

    **Item 213: two of the thirteen are not producers.**  `Or.imp` (39) and
    `dite` (4) are PIPES — they carry a decision made elsewhere — so 43 of those

    this census's 79 `VIA` edges named a combinator rather than a decider and
    could say nothing about what stood behind them; `resolve` now follows them,
    and this is the answer.  `producers=0` is the row that matters and it is
    asserted as a COUNT, not by being absent from the list: **not one of the 43
    reaches a producer.**  `piped=43` is the same total item 213 derived by
    parsing the row above, now measured rather than parsed, so the two
    instruments can still disagree.

    The landing, read as provenance: 26 are a park or bundle FIELD, 10 are the
    caller's own binder, 7 are a case split — 3 an `Or.casesOn` reached through
    the pipe and 4 the `dite` arms themselves.

    **Item 215 split the first row where item 214 could only assert it.**  Item
    214 read the 26 off the probe by hand and reported 21 of them bound inside
    an `Eq.ndrec`; `peelPipe` now resolves exactly those 21 to `FIELD`, and the
    5 that stay `LOCAL` are the ones under a SATURATED pipe, which transports a
    function nobody applies.  The hand count and the instrument agree, and the
    total is still 43 with still no producer among them. -/

/-- What the SPLITs decide (DOCS item 216), and the row that matters is
    `elsewhere=0`: **not one leaf of any case split in this module is decided
    anywhere but at the site.**  It is asserted as a COUNT, not by being absent
    from the list.

    `resolve` enters every arm now.  An arm's answer is an answer per BRANCH, so
    the only split that can be reported as one answer is one whose arms agree —
    and exactly ONE of the 156 does, a chain of six splitters
    (`Or.casesOn→Exists.casesOn→Exists.casesOn→And.casesOn→And.casesOn→dite`)
    that all land on `PAY`.  The other 155 keep the `SPLIT` label and carry
    their leaves, which is what the shape list below counts.

    **That one is named in `expectedCollapsedEdge` as of item 218**, and naming
    it was not bookkeeping: it is the site N-218 broke at where the join
    predicted no break, because its `have` ascribes the wide `_ ∨ True` while
    its proof pays on all six branches.

    **Item 287: one split fewer**, the value park's split on `h_vslot51`, which
    left with the binder it supplied (`expectedTally`): `survived` 156 → 155,
    `leaves` 330 → 328, one `DECLINE|PAY`.  **Item 288: one more**,
    `compact_open_map`'s split on the indicator, which supplied

/-- **Which BRANCH is taken (DOCS item 217).**  Item 216 resolved what a split
    WRITES — both answers, one per arm.  What it could not say was which arm the
    runtime takes, and the answer is that the site almost never chooses:
    **145 of the 155 surviving splits branch on a value the CALLER supplied**,
    99 of them directly on one of the caller's own binders and 46 through a
    constructor field carved out of one.  Ten — and only ten — branch on a fact
    the site derives for itself; they are listed in `expectedSiteDecided`.

    ~~99 split on a `RELAY`~~ — that was item 216's own discriminant column read
    only as far as its bare `RELAY` rows, and it skipped both the 46 chains that
    reach a relay through a field and the 9 nested splits that reach one through
    another split.  **The number is 145.**

    Of the 145, **99 root at a premise that is itself a `_ ∨ True`** — the site
    is casing on whether its OWN CALLER declined, and then declining in the arm
    where the caller did.  Their host premises are `expectedBranchPremises`.

    `agree=99/99` is the control, and it is a cross-check rather than a restated
    count: for every split whose discriminant is a bare relay, the splitter's
    DECLARED major-premise type — read off the splitter's own type by
    `majorOf`/`binderHead` — is compared with the type of the premise the chain
    roots at, read off the enclosing lemma's type.  Neither reading goes through
    the proof term the census walks, so a wrong `major` index would show up here
    as a disagreement rather than as a plausible column.

    The leaf rows are `orArgRefs`: **164 of the 168 `DECLINE` leaves are
    `closed`**, an `Or.inr trivial` that mentions nothing in scope, and all 160
    `PAY` leaves are `free`.  That asymmetry is what made N-217 predictable by
    line: a `closed` decline cannot break when the premise its split branches on
    is narrowed.

    **Item 287 moves six roots.**  Five splits branch on
    `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`'s own `h_vslot` (`expectedBranchSupply`'s
    row for it read `splits=5`), and they stay and change their ROOT's kind,
    because that binder stopped being a `_ ∨ True`: `optionalRoot` 100 → 95.
    The sixth is the value park's split on its park's `h_vslot` FIELD — a
    plain root — which left with the binder it supplied (`relayRooted`
    146 → 145, one `DECLINE-closed` and one `PAY-free` with it): `plainRoot`
    46 + 5 − 1 = 50.  **Item 288** removes `compact_open_map`'s split on the
    indicator `hc`, a plain root and a bare relay, with the field it supplied:
    `relayRooted` 145 → 144, `plainRoot` 50 → 49, the control 100 → 99. -/
def expectedSplitBranch : String :=
  "splits=154 leaves=326 relayRooted=144 siteDecided=10 optionalRoot=95 \
plainRoot=49 agree=99/99 disagree=0 [DECLINE-closed=163, DECLINE-free=4, PAY-free=159]"

/-- **The ten splits the site decides for itself**, which is the whole residue
    of the branch question after `expectedSplitBranch`.  Four are a `dite` on a
    condition the site tests (`VIA Eq`, `VIA LE.le`); five case an `Or`-valued
    fact the site derives (`Nat.eq_zero_or_pos`, `frameChainUnion`); one reaches
    its fact through a nested split (`preprocess_some_savedKey_shape`).

    `dite`'s `major` is argument 1 — the PROPOSITION, not a proof of it — so
    `VIA Eq` and `VIA LE.le` naming a type here is the instrument reading the
    condition, not losing the discriminant. -/

/-- **Is a DECLINE arm ever SELECTED (DOCS item 218).**  Item 217 named, for
    each of the 99 optional-rooted splits, the premise its branch is taken on.
    It could not say whether any caller ever takes the declining branch.  This
    joins the two halves of the census that had never met — every split's
    `(caller, rootTgt)` against every supply edge's `(callee, idx)` — and
    chases the result upward to the labels it terminates in.

    `dead=0` is the row that matters: **not one of the 36 branch premises has a
    DECLINE arm that nothing can select.**  `direct=8` is the row that was a
    surprise: only 8 of the 36 have a caller that writes `Or.inr trivial`
    straight into them, so **a decline is almost never written where it is
    branched on** — 25 of the remaining 28 reach it through a park's
    construction sites, one hop up.

    `orphan=3` is the census DECLINING to answer and is reported apart from
    `dead` for that reason: those three leave the module at
    `colon_fires_implicit_key`/`colon_fires_props_key`'s `h_key`, and a walk
    that is scoped to one module cannot see who fills a premise from outside
    it.  This is the first item at which that horizon bit.

    `accounted` is the control: the join must PARTITION the census, so it has to
    equal `edges`.  `resolved` is the second: every `FIELD` edge must name a
    constructor field, or the `FIELD` hop is guessing. -/
-- Item 287: `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`'s `h_vslot` left the population
-- (`expectedTally`), and the join with it: one pair, which its ten callers

-- Item 288: `accum_content_on_pendingMapValue_indented`'s `h_vslot` is fed by
-- the park's field through `.imp _ (fun _ => trivial)`, and the field is not a

    once for each of them — so the **19 names** are the claim and the numbers
    are how the machine re-derives them.

    This is the domain a corpus census would have to cover, and it is the
    number item 218 exists to produce: **the runtime question is not 99 splits
    wide, it is these nineteen lemmas' construction sites wide.**  Most of them
    write their declines while CONSTRUCTING a park rather than at the site that
    branches — `expectedBranchSupply`'s `⇐` column names the park field for
    every row that does, and `direct=8` is the same fact counted the other way
    round.

    **Item 259 moves one down.**  A lemma's number is the number of chases
    that END at a decline it writes (`terminals` pushes the caller of a
    `DECLINE` terminal, or of a `SPLIT` with a `DECLINE` leaf); a payment turns
    that terminal into a `PAY`, which is no site, and the compact opener's
    payment of `pendingMapValue.h_closeF` takes it from 16 to 15 — where
    items 257 and 258's payments moved their lemmas' numbers UP, because the
    count follows the chase and not the direction of the payment.  Predict it
    from the chase, or read it from the run. -/
-- Item 287: the eleven declines written into `accum_block_on_closeThenBlock`'s
-- `h_vslot` left with that binder — two by `…_pendingContent`, one each by
-- `…_pendingBlockContent` and `…_pendingBlock`, and seven by
-- `accum_block_pending` (six flat, one the value park's split branch).
-- Item 288: and one each from the four producers that declined
-- `pendingMapValue.h_vslot` with `True`, which they now pay with the stamp.

/-- **The ONE collapsed split, named.**  Item 216 measured `collapsed=1` and

    because N-218 broke at exactly it: narrowing `pendingBlock.h_closeF` gave
    the five lemmas the join predicted, and this site — whose proof pays on
    every one of its six branches — was the eighth error where seven were
    forecast.  **A `PAY` is an answer about the PROOF and a narrowing is a
    question about the TYPE**: the `have` at
    [StreamAccum.lean:21853](../../../L4YAML/Proofs/Production/StreamAccum.lean)
    ascribes the wide `_ ∨ True` and pays it on every branch, so the census is
    right that nothing declines there and the narrowing breaks at the USE site
    all the same. -/
