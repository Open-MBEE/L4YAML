# The column walk is one pass carrying three conclusions (DOCS item 235)

Item 234 refuted the column law as item 233 stated it and kept the half a
refuter needs — `BreakBetween s s' → s'.col < |span s s'|`.  Its NEXT asked
the one number nothing held: **can that walk and the span walk be ONE
induction, or does item 232's finding apply again — a mutual block does not
share a fixpoint, so each conclusion is paid for separately?**

The answer is that the question had the wrong pair in it, and that the sharing
is real.

## There are two column conclusions, not one

`BreakBetween s s' → s'.col < |span s s'|` does not compose with itself.  Put
a break in the FIRST half of a two-premise arm and the strict bound on that
half has to be carried across the second, which needs

    s'.col ≤ s.col + |span s s'|                                  (MONOTONE)

— a second statement over the same 167 arms.  §1 does not report this as a
stuck goal: `strict_alone_refuted` REFUTES the composition of the strict bound
alone, with a three-position counterexample, and `counterexample_violates_mono`
shows MONOTONE is exactly what excludes it.

MONOTONE composes with itself and never needs the strict bound, so the
dependency is a one-way chain and not a cycle.  Both arrangements therefore
typecheck, and the question is a price, not a possibility.

## The span is carried, not consumed

The span is not a third walk.  `ColLaw` bundles it, `ColLaw.trans` is
self-contained, and `colLaw_to_suffix` projects the bundle back onto
`SurfaceSpan`'s conclusion — so the span walk is a COMPONENT of the column
walk, not a prerequisite of it.  Fetching each span from a `*_suffix` lemma
instead costs a span citation per link plus an accumulation per composition
node: on the longest arm in the flow cycle, `[150] ns-flow-pair`'s explicit
value form, 13 citations become 52.

## The price, and where it is re-derived

§3 is the recursion's real shape: the closure is **62 strongly connected
components, of which only 8 recurse**.  The eighteen-type mutual block of
`Surface/Node.lean` is not one cycle — it is a 9-type cycle, an 8-type cycle,
and `SImplicitKey`, which is in neither.

§4 prices a walk in the only currency the arms have: a LINK, one citation of a
sub-derivation's own lemma.  One walk carrying every conclusion costs `links`;
two walks cost `2 * links + (links - arms)`, because the second must re-cite
the first at every composition node.  For the whole closure that is **319
against 790**.

Both numbers were checked against compiled Lean before they were pinned.  The
flow cycle — 8 types, 41 arms, the bottom cycle of the mutual family — was
proved three ways in `L4YAML/Scratch` (DOCS item 235): one mutual block
carrying span, MONOTONE and the strict bound (8 lemmas, 41 arms, 123
citations), and the same cycle as two mutual blocks (16 lemmas, 82 arms, 328
citations).  §4's formula reproduces both from the environment alone.

## What this does not say

Nothing here proves the column law over the grammar.  §2 discharges the base
case and the exception — the three `SBBreak` resets, where the strict bound is
the only place it is not vacuous, and `[202] l-document-prefix`'s byte-order
mark, the arm that refuted item 233's equality — and everything else is a
price.

/-! ## §3 The recursion's real shape

A walk is one lemma per production, but only a CYCLE needs a fixpoint.  This
reads the population item 234 censused and reports its strongly connected
components — edges taken from constructor PREMISES, because a constructor's
conclusion names its own type and would make every production a self-loop. -/

/-! ## §4 What a walk costs

A LINK is a constructor premise that is itself a production between two
positions — the one place a walk cites a sub-derivation's own lemma.  One pass
carrying every conclusion costs one citation per link.  Two passes cost twice
that, plus one re-citation of the first pass at every composition node, and a
composition node is a link that is not the first of its arm. -/

  "arms=167 links=319 oneWalk=319 twoWalks=790 defProds=9 defCitations=39"

    experiment walked three times. -/

  "flow arms=41 links=123 oneWalk=123 twoWalks=328 | block arms=26 links=63 \

/-! ## §5 What the walk can already cite, and what it cannot

Every link is a citation of the sub-production's own lemma, so the walk's
input supply is the set of productions that HAVE one.  `SurfaceSpan.lean` and
`SurfaceSpanSupply.lean` together supply 84 of the 92 productions a link can
point at.  The eight this census does not reach are seven `abbrev`s — item
229's five, plus `SBlockLinePrefix` and `SENode` — where a walk cites the
aliased production's lemma and needs no statement of its own, and
`SLYamlStream`, which §6 reads and finds missing because it is FALSE.

The reading is over the census's own import closure, so it measures what a
walk compiled HERE could cite; the same census run without
`SurfaceSpanSupply.lean` in scope reports a supply that is short by the
fifteen lemmas that module carries.  `Tests/Guards/Proofs/SuffixGapAudit.lean`
(DOCS item 236) splits the eight and carries the arm-connectivity census that
says which side a production falls on. -/

/-! ## §6 One of the twenty-three is missing because it is FALSE

`[211] l-yaml-stream` has no span lemma, and it cannot have one.  Its
`scannerDrop` arm takes `SLYamlStream s s₁` and `SSLComments s₂ s'` with `s₁`
and `s₂` UNRELATED — the module docstring calls the gap opaque — so the
conclusion `SLYamlStream s s'` rests on evidence that never connects `s` to
`s'`.  Below is a derivation whose target holds three characters its source
never had.

So "23 productions without a span lemma" is not 23 unpaid obligations.  Some
of them are refutations, and the precondition for a column walk that reaches
the document layer is row 12's own β.5 work — retiring `scannerDrop` — not 23
