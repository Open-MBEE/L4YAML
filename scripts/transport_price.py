"""What the APPLIED source still owes the carrier (DOCS item 272).

Item 271 priced the coordinate `preprocess_landing_on_stack`'s premises cost at
the three arms that spend `drop_ride`, and item 272 landed the one real debt:
`preprocess_some_separate_at_floor`'s under-run disjunct carries item 147's
floor, so all three premises are readable at the arm and the source APPLIES.

Item 268 priced four rings for a carrier — `gate=49 anchor=2 route=3 eof=1` —
against a source that could not be applied at all.  This script asks the
question those numbers were taken before: with the source applied, what stands
between the membership it returns and a frame the close can spend?

    source    the membership at the arm: null (`assumption`) against the named
              composition.  This is the applied source, read by elaboration.
    hcol      the same membership in the shape `ParkSlot.ofOpen` names it —
              over the OPEN TOKEN's column rather than the landing's cursor —
              with the source offered as the named derivation.  The row is the
              gap, and the elaborator's own message names it.
    genesis   `ParkSlot s_prep s' 0` at the arm, GIVEN the position equation as
              a hypothesis.  A `B` here says the position equation is the only
              thing missing: everything else the genesis asks for is bound.
    optok     the arity flip on `h_optok`, item 165's own hypothesis — who must
              supply the open token's position.  This is the ring.
    frames    the arity flip on `h_kpkg`, the frame builder — how many frames
              the declaration constructs, all inside one declaration, so the
              census is of SITES and the declaration count is 1 by
              construction.
    ride      whether each arm's own binder is visible where `drop_ride` is
              BUILT.  The ride is one `have` before `cases h_pending`, so the
              data the source needs postdates the term that would carry it; the
              row is the second ring, and no arity flip can see it because a
              `have` has no arity.

The arm table is IMPORTED from `coordinate_price.py` rather than restated: item
271 found a shipped instrument naming the wrong arm, and two copies of a table
drift in exactly that way.

Every probe restores the file it edited and prints the md5 either side.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/transport_price.py source
    python3 scripts/transport_price.py all      # every probe but `wide`
