# The COMPACT route's emptiness, re-measured at the runtime (item 204)

> **ITEM 209: the route is GONE.**  `block_dispatch_deferred_stamp_compact` is
> deleted and both of its sites are `compact_deferral_refuted … |>.elim`.  What
> this module measured is therefore no longer a property of a live escape
> class; it is the corpus evidence that stood behind the refutation while the
> refutation was unspendable, and it stays as that.  The proof's own runtime
> reading is `BlockDeferralClasses` §28.3, which measures the STRICT floor at
> the preprocessed state — the fact `[197]`'s equation needs and never gets.

`block_dispatch_deferred_stamp_compact`'s two sites are reached by a `:` whose
dispatch state has the stamp source UNDECIDED — the explicit-key register live,
the cleared key not surviving, and the `:` standing at `explicitKeyCol` — and
whose step satisfies `InlineResidue`: the park is off column 0 and the step
crossed NO break.

Item 185 measured that family empty with a SYNTACTIC proxy (a sweep of 35 937
three-line programs, counting programs that "carry a compact `:`").  The
sentence "2 sites, measured empty" then rode nineteen consecutive items, and
the sweep that produced it was not re-derivable — §10's own failure mode
("a number no instrument can re-derive is a guess"), at three times the length
of the record case item 166 set.

This module re-derives it, and reads the wrapper's OWN premise off the scanner
state instead of guessing it from the text.  The domain is the same shape as
item 185's: a 33-fragment line alphabet, three lines, 35 937 programs.

**The measurement.**  244 programs reach the premise; ZERO of those are
accepted; and all 244 are refused by ONE error — §8.2.2 `[197]`'s own
`s-indent(n)` test, which is the very equation `explicit_at_indent_of_dispatch`
reads forwards.  The class is empty over this domain because the scanner
refuses every input that would enter it.

**Why the zero is not vacuous, and why the syntactic proxy was not enough.**
Two controls ride with it.  The domain REACHES the premise 244 times, so the
zero is a refusal rather than an empty search.  And dropping the `InlineResidue`
conjunct alone raises the accepted count from 0 to 916 — so the zero is
produced by the MID-LINE requirement and not by a discriminator that never
fires.  A first version of this instrument tested the shape on the program TEXT
(a mid-line `?` at column x, a mid-line `:` at column x on a later line) and
reported 28 accepted hits; every one was a false positive, the register having
been consumed by an intervening column-0 `:`.  The state, not the text, is what
carries the premise.
