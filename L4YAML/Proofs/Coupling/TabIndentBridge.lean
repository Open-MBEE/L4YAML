# The located tab, and the scanner's backward scan (DOCS item 32)

`gstar_white_sIndent_or_tab` splits the whitespace run a step leaves in front
of a block indicator: either it is `[63] s-indent(k)` — spaces only — or it
carries a TAB, which `[63]` cannot derive.  Item 31 made the second arm
REFUTABLE by giving `?` and `:` the §6.1 backward scan `-` already had.  This
file is the refutation's other half: the arm's tab, LOCATED, is the same
character the scanner's own backward scan reads.

Three steps, none of which mentions the block indicators:

1. **Runs consume a prefix.**  Every production `[79] s-l-comments` is built
   from advances the surface position, so its end characters are a suffix of
   its start characters.  This is what puts the run inside `input.toList`
   rather than merely beside it — without it, a tab "in the run" and a tab
   "before the scanner's offset" are statements about different lists.
2. **The run, as characters.**  A `GStar SSWhite` walk from the landing to the
   indicator is a list of `s-white`s whose length is the indicator's column
   (the landing is at column 0), and the located disjunct puts a `'\t'` inside
   that list.
3. **The backward walks find it.**  `hasTabInPrecedingWhitespaceLoop` and
   `tabInLineIndentLoop` step `prev`/`get` exactly the way
   `peekBack_eq_last_prefix` does, one character at a time, so a run of whites
   ending at the scanner's offset is walked to its start.

The two loops differ in their stopping rule and so answer different questions:
the first reports the run it walked (`[66] s-separate-in-line`, which admits a
tab), the second walks the whole line and reports `false` if anything on it is
not a white (`[63] s-indent(n)`, which does not).  Both are `true` here,
because the landing IS the line start.

The generic family — `[28] b-break` through `[79] s-l-comments` and the
combinator transports they are built from — moved to

the other 63 productions of the same closure and imports only the grammar.

/-! ## §4 Preprocessing does not change the input string

`ScannerSurfCorr` names `sc.input`, so a suffix fact carried on the state
BEFORE preprocessing speaks about a different `String` from the one the
preprocessed state's backward scan reads — unless the two are the same one.
They are: none of the five functions `skipToContent` descends through writes
`input`, and neither does `unwindIndents` or `saveSimpleKey`.  The same
mechanical descent `PreprocessIndentStable` makes for the indent stack. -/
