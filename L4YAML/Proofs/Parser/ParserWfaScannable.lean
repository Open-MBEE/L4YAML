# The `Scannable`-valued parse-side anchor table

`ParserScannableBase` mirrors the COMPOSE chain: `resolveAliasesOrdered` reads
the threaded environment, so `WellFormedEnvS` is the only well-formedness
hypothesis it needs.  The PARSE side has a second table — `ParseState.anchors`,
written by `ParseState.addAnchor` at node finalization and read by
`resolveAliases` — and `WellFormedAnchors` requires every value in it to be
`Grammable` after stripping.

That is false for a node that has itself as a descendant via an alias.
`&x [*x]` binds `x` to a value which still carries `.alias "x"`, and `Grammable`
has no alias constructor at all, so the parse-side predicate cannot hold of the
table the parser actually builds for that input — see
`Tests/Guards/Proofs/AliasNodeRoute.lean`, where both halves of that are
machine-checked (`alias_not_grammable`, `selfDesc_not_aar`).

This module mirrors the parse-side table onto `Scannable`, which is `Grammable`
plus the `| alias` constructor.  Each declaration below is its `Grammable`
original with the predicate renamed, and **one carries new content**:
`compose_value_scannable` takes no `AllAliasesResolve` hypothesis.  Its
`Grammable` original needs one because its alias case has to *find* the resolved
value before `WellFormedAnchors` can speak about it; the mirror splits on the
lookup instead and closes the missing branch with `Scannable.alias`.  That is
the whole difference, and it is why the mirror can carry a shape the original
refuses: the parse-time table legitimately misses for a self-descendant node,
because a collection's anchor binds only after its items are resolved.

/-- The `Scannable`-valued mirror of `WellFormedAnchors`: every value in the

/-- C1 for the parse-side table, **with no `AllAliasesResolve` hypothesis**.

    The alias case splits on the lookup rather than being handed a witness that
    it succeeds: where the table has the name, `WellFormedAnchorsS` speaks about
    the value it found; where it misses, `resolveAliases` returns the alias
    itself and `Scannable.alias` carries it.  The missing branch is exactly the
    self-descendant node, and it is unreachable in the `Grammable` original —
    which is why that original can demand resolution and this mirror cannot. -/
