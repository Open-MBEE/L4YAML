"""What the frame's CLOSE can pay for a reshaped carrier (DOCS item 274).

Item 273 priced what receives the carrier and recorded the next step: reshape
`FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm to `choice`, because the close is where the shape
is decided.  `FlowBaseAnchor.gate` proves `GateOf g` off `ParkAnchor`'s
EQUATION between two verdicts; `ParkSlot`'s two spends make a verdict FIRE
instead.  So the question this script asks is not what the reshape costs to
WRITE -- item 273 read that as `3 + 7` -- but what the slot branch of `gate`
can be closed with, and whether the premises it needs can be named where the
spend is applied.

    anchor    the control: `gate`'s existing proof, restated as a standalone
              probe over `ParkAnchor`.  It must read `B`, or the instrument is
              measuring its own scaffolding rather than the carriers.
    bare      the slot branch from the premises `gate` has today.
    nonoffer  the same, with §9.2's own two premises supplied -- the run
              STARTS at the open and the token in front of it offers no slot.
    offer     the same, with §8.1's premise supplied instead.
    floor     `offer` plus the close's own §8.1 reading.

    name      the premise the slot branch needs, written over `sc0`, on
              `FlowBaseAnchor.gate` and on `FlowBaseAnchor.gate_of_close`.
    wrap      the same premise written over `g` (`∀ sc0, g = some sc0 → …`).
    gate      the arity census of the wrapped premise on `gate`;
    close     the same on `gate_of_close` -- who must WRITE one;
    closable  the same on `PendingNode.pendingContent`'s `h_closable`, which
              is where a verdict on the close's own state lands -- the count of
              sites a FURTHER one would cost, re-derived where item 275 paid
              the second.

The five probes are ONE insertion and ONE elaboration: they are separate
declarations, so a refusal is reported against the probe that wrote it and the
others still read.  Each carries a null twin (`by assumption`) that must FAIL,
which is what says the row measured a derivation rather than a hypothesis the
scaffolding handed it.

The two rows that read `B` close by EX FALSO, so their premise sets are
contradictory on purpose and "is it vacuous" is the wrong question to ask of
them -- the contradiction IS the reading.  What is worth asking is whether each
half is realized by real inputs, and §14's sweep answers it: the slot-side
premises hold at 54 cells and 90, and the close-side reading each contradicts
(`hnd`, `hui`) is false at exactly those same cells.

Every probe restores the file it edited and prints the md5 either side.
