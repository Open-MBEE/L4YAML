# What a dispatch equation buys (DOCS item 242)

Item 241 refuted derivability at the park's producer: a `ScannerSurfCorr` is a
statement about a POINT and the datum `SLYamlStream sp_start sp_scan'` is a
statement about a PATH, and the library turns one into the other at the stream's
seed and nowhere else.  Its recorded NEXT named the four consumers as holding
what the producer does not — a dispatch equation and a second correspondence,
at the position BEFORE the step — and called that pair the first thing in the
chain that could turn a point into a path.

**Three of those four hold no dispatch equation.**
`block_dispatch_deferred_inline`, `…_stamp_nopack` and `…_stamp_offcol` carry
branch evidence — `_h_src`, `_h_indent`, `_h_ne`, `_h_park`, `_h_res` — and pass
the producer's own five arguments straight through.  `accum_content_pending` is
the one that holds `scanNextToken_dispatchContent … = .ok s'`, and its second
correspondence is its CONCLUSION rather than a hypothesis.  So the census below
is taken over the whole population instead of over that ring.

## The answer: availability is 294 and derivation is 1

§2 reads every authored statement for a scanner step equation `f … = .ok …`
and for a grammar path landing on the position the step's output names.

| rung | what it asks | count |
|---|---|---|
| `dispHolders` | a `scanNextToken_dispatch*` equation is held | **294** |
| `dispTwoCorr` | …with two correspondences beside it | **28** |
| `edge` | a production LANDS on the step's output position | **4** |
| `chain` | a production path RUNS from a known point to it | **1** |

The one is `indentedValue_reads_at_any_indent`, and per FUNCTION the reading is
sharper still: of **72** distinct scanner step functions appearing in step
equations, **one** carries a numbered spec production across it and **two**
carry any Surface relation at all — `scanNextToken_preprocess` (6 of its 186
holders) and `scanNextToken_dispatchContent` (1 of its 129).  The step that
consumes SEPARATION is grammar-visible and routine; the step that consumes
CONTENT is grammar-visible once.  **A census that counts equations measures
availability, and the two numbers are 294 and 1.**

`indentedValue_reads_at_any_indent` is in neither item 238's transitive set nor
either repair thread, so the one worked precedent stands outside β.5's bill.

## And the escape's repaired form needs no arm at all

`SLYamlStream.scannerDrop` takes a stream to `s₁` and an `SSLComments` from an
unrelated `s₂`, which is what makes it hold of every string.  §1 proves that
**connecting the two halves makes the arm redundant**: given `SLYamlStream a b`
and `SSLComments b c`, `SLYamlStream a c` follows from `implicitContinue`,
`SLDocumentPrefix.comments` and the fact that an `s-b-comment` is an
`l-comment`.  `connected_drop_nd` proves the same in item 239's post-β.5 model,
where the arm is gone, so the derivation is not circular — and the pin below
checks that neither proof mentions `SLYamlStream.scannerDrop`.

**So the grammar side of β.5 is three lines, and the whole bill is the
connection.**  What items 240 and 241 priced — nineteen statements threading a
premise through `close_with_ssl`, or eighteen through the producer — is not the
cost of proving the step; it is the cost of establishing that the production
starts where the stream ends.

**The derivation leans on a documented deviation from the spec.**  [66]
`s-separate-in-line` is `s-white+ | <start-of-line>`, and
`SSeparateInLine.startOfLine` holds at EVERY position in this library
(`L4YAML/Surface/Basic.lean`, which records the weakening and the ~20 proof
sites it was taken to avoid).  `ssb_to_slcomment`'s `noSep` branch spends
exactly that, and the pin below records the dependency rather than leaving it
to a reader.  Under the spec's own column restriction the branch would need the
comment run to begin at column 0.

/-! ## §3 The pins -/

/-- The grammar's alphabet over surface positions, three nested populations.
    `prodTyped` takes every relation whose last two arguments are `SurfPos` and
    so includes the proof layer's own composites (`PendingNode`, `BlockStack`,
    `ImplicitKeyHead`, `PropsRun`); `prodSurf` keeps the `L4YAML/Surface`
    modules, which are the spec transcription and its combinators; `prodSpec`
    keeps only what carries a NUMBERED `@[yaml_spec]` rule.  A combinator
    application like `GStar SSWhite` is headed by `GStar`, which carries no rule
    number of its own, which is why `prodSurf` and not `prodSpec` is the
    population the findings are read over. -/
def expectedAlphabet : String := "prodTyped=129 prodSurf=92 prodSpec=54"

/-- The step population, which no choice of grammar moves: 1649 statements hold
    a scanner step equation, 294 of them a dispatch equation, and 28 of those
    hold it with two correspondences — the pair item 241's NEXT called the first
    thing that could turn a point into a path.  Of the 72 step functions, 26 are
    the indexed twin's.

    Item 267 adds the three that hold one: the carrier's source
    (`preprocess_landing_on_stack`), the dedent it reads it through
    (`preprocess_pops_of_below`) and the `skipToContent` wrapper their proof
    spends.  None is a dispatch and both functions were already among the 72, so
    only the first count moves.

    Item 269 adds one more, `preprocess_floor_eq`, which is where the step
    equation is spent for all three.  The fourth declaration of that source,
    `landing_on_stack_of_floor_eq`, holds NONE: it reads one state's own stack
    against one state's own column and names no scanner step, which is what
    makes it the cheap end of the chain.

    Item 272 adds one, `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack`, the composition that
    applies that source at an arm holding the `[63]` failure located: it hands
    the step equation on to `preprocess_landing_on_stack`, so it holds one.
    Item 271's `underRunEnd_col_le_currentIndent` holds none and moves nothing
    here — it reads the landing's column off the under-run and names no step,
    which is the same reason `landing_on_stack_of_floor_eq` sits outside the
    population.

    Moved to 1654 on 2026-10-02 by ONE holder and no new step:
    `parseStream_output_scannable_composed`, the hypothesis-free `Scannable`
    twin of `parseStream_output_grammable`, carries the same
    `Scanner.scanFiltered input = .ok tokens` premise and so names the same
    step its sibling does.  Its indexed twin takes `FlowAwarePSVIx` rather than
    `scanFilteredIx` and names none, which is why this is +1 and not +2 —
    `fns` holds at 72 and `fnsIx` at 26, so the step population itself is
    unmoved and only the holder count changed. -/

/-- **The ladder, at each population.**  `edge` is a production whose right
    endpoint is the step's output; `chain` requires a path to it from another
    correspondence's position, existential midpoints allowed — which is what
    `implicitKeyHead_of_dispatch` needs and a single edge misses.  The counts

    number moves.  Item 269 adds the third, `preprocess_floor_eq`, which is
    where both of those now spend the equation; it carries no path either.
    Item 272 adds the fourth, `underRunEnd_landing_on_stack`, which hands the
