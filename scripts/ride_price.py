"""What the RIDE can carry, and what the frame will receive (DOCS item 273).

Item 272 priced the ring an applied source needs — a conjunct on item 165's
`h_optok`, three sites in two declarations — and recorded an order for item
273: build the ride per arm first, because paying `optok` on its own adds a
premise two call sites must discharge for a carrier nothing spends.

That order was written from what each ring buys.  This script asks the question
it was written before: **what receives the carrier.**  A ride that takes a
`ParkSlot` has exactly one place to put it — the frame's own
`FlowBaseAnchor g s' 0` argument — and `FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm names
`ParkAnchor`, a different carrier over the same core.

    slot      `ParkSlot s_prep s' 0` at the arm, ring PAID.  This is item 272's
              `pay` row re-taken as a standing fact rather than under a
              hypothesis: the payment is applied to the module and the probe
              carries no holes.
    floor     `ParkFloor s_prep s' 0` at the same arm — the frame's other half.
    prop_sc   `ParkAnchor`'s own field at the state the STEP began with, where
              the props arm can name it (`propsPark_prevReal_prop`).
    prop      the same field at the LANDING's park, which is the only park this
              family can open over (item 272's P3: preprocessing's pushes sit
              between the two arrays).
    gated     `FlowBaseAnchor (some s_prep) s' 0` — the frame argument itself,
              built as `slot_ride` builds it (DOCS item 285): the slot on
              `ParkChoice`'s right, beside the floor.  The `ParkAnchor` route
              on its left is `prop`'s question, so the column does not ask it
              twice.

    ride      the arity flip on `have drop_ride` — how many terms spend the
              ride.  A `have` has no arity to the repo, so this is the only way
              to count them, and the count is of SITES inside one declaration.
    carrier   three reshapes of `FlowBaseAnchor`'s `some` arm, each a census by
              declaration: `add` puts `ParkSlot` beside the anchor (item 268's
              `anchor` ring, re-derived), `swap` puts it in the anchor's place,
              `anchor` restores item 162's anchor-only arm.  Item 276 PAID the
              `choice` reshape, so each flip now prices UN-paying it.
    transport the arity flip on `FlowBaseAnchor.transport`, the funnel every
              other carrier lemma goes through — the second wave any reshape
              pays.

The arm table is IMPORTED from `coordinate_price.py` and the payment from
`transport_price.py`; two copies of either drift (item 271).

Every probe restores the file it edited and prints the md5 either side.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ride_price.py arm
    python3 scripts/ride_price.py all       # every probe but `wide`
    python3 scripts/ride_price.py wide      # the tree census, minutes
