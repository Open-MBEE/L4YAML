"""CI gate: the Reflections index describes itself accurately.

`Tests/Reflections.lean` has two independent halves.  Its `import` lines are
load-bearing (they are what makes the demos build), and `check_import_closure.py`
already gates those.  Below them is a *narrative* index: `## theme` /
`### sub-theme (Reflections N, M, ...)` headings, each followed by
`* `DemoModule` — Reflection N (...)` bullets.  Nothing checked that half, and it
drifted: Reflections 630-641 sat for weeks under a sub-theme whose own number
list never mentioned them, while that list claimed five of them, so a reader
searching by number was sent to the wrong block or to none.

Checks (each a hard failure):

1. **Bullet names resolve.**  Every bullet's backticked module is imported by the
   index.  (Not the converse — the docstring declares the bullet list PARTIAL, so
   an imported demo with no bullet is deliberate, not a defect.)
2. **Bullets are claimed.**  Every Reflection number in a bullet's label appears
   in the number list of the sub-theme heading that bullet sits under.  A demo
   covering several reflections must have all of them listed.
3. **Claims are backed.**  Every number in a sub-theme's list has a bullet in
   that same block.  A list is a description of its block, not a wish.
4. **No number is claimed twice.**  Two bullets carrying the same Reflection
   number means one of them is misattributed.
5. **Blocks ascend.**  Bullets within a block are ordered by their primary
   (first) Reflection number, so appending is unambiguous.
