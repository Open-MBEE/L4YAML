# `[104] c-ns-alias-node` — the route is inhabited

A definition nothing has instantiated is not yet evidence, so this file spends
the alias route on the one input it exists for: `&x [*x]`, an anchored sequence
whose only item is an alias to its own anchor.  YAML 1.2.2 permits it — §3.2.1.3
legislates the *equality* of a node that "has itself as a descendant (via an
alias)" and nowhere forbids one, and §3.2.2.2 binds an alias to the most recent
*event* carrying the anchor, which the anchored collection's start supplies.

`YamlValue` expresses sharing by substitution and nothing else, so composing
this shape leaves a `.alias` in the result.  `Grammable` has no alias
constructor, so the chain ends in `Scannable` and reaches `ValidNode` through
`scannableValue_has_witness`.  The last lemma below is the conclusion of the
capstone `parseStream_respects_grammar_unconditional`, discharged for this
input.

The `#guard`s record what the runtime does with the same shape today: `compose`
maps the anchored and unanchored trees to the same value, and the style-aware
writer loses the `&x` while keeping the `*x`.  Both are properties of `compose`,
not of the proofs above, and they are what plan row 5a(v)'s load-side edit
addresses.

/-! ## What `compose` does with the same shape

`compose` is `(resolveAliasesOrdered …).fst.stripAnchors`, and `stripAnchors`
clears `anchor` on every collection while leaving `.alias` untouched.  So the
binder does not survive and the alias does: the anchored and unanchored trees
compose to the same value, and `Dump` writes an alias naming an anchor the
document no longer declares. -/

/-- `[*x]` — the same tree with no binder at all. -/
def unboundDoc : YamlDocument := { value := .sequence .flow #[.alias "x"] none none }

-- `compose` does not distinguish the bound shape from the unbound one.
#guard boundDoc.compose.value == unboundDoc.compose.value

-- The style-aware writer shows both halves: `&x` before composition, gone
-- after; `*x` throughout.
#guard Dump.dump boundDoc.value == "&x [*x]"
#guard Dump.dump boundDoc.compose.value == "[*x]"

-- The canonical emitter sees neither — it writes no anchor for any value and
-- routes `.alias` through `emitScalar`, which double-quotes unconditionally.
#guard Emit.emit boundDoc.value == "[\"*x\"]"
#guard Emit.emit boundDoc.value == Emit.emit unboundDoc.value

/-! ## §3.2.2.2 resolution, with no whole-document table

`resolveAliasesOrdered` resolves an alias against the ordered environment and
nothing else, which is what §3.2.2.2 specifies: *the most recent preceding
node carrying the anchor*.  The rows below pin that on every legitimate shape
the environment has to cover — an earlier sibling, a completed subtree, a
closed collection, a rebound anchor, a chain, and a second document.

The rebound rows are the ones that distinguish the two readings: a whole-document
first-match lookup answers `"a"` for *both* aliases in `[&x a, *x, &x b, *x]`,
and §3.2.2.2 requires `"b"` for the second. -/

      String.intercalate " | " (docs.toList.map (fun d => Emit.emit (d : YamlDocument).value))
